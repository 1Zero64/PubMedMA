    "In diesem Projekt wird ein Large Language Model (LLM) genutzt, um Informationen aus PubMed-Papers systematisch zu extrahieren und als strukturierte Medical Records in einer Datenbank (DB) zu speichern. Diese Datenbank ermöglicht umfassende Meta-Analysen von medizinischen Studien, um effizientere und robustere Erkenntnisse zu Krankheiten, Medikamenten und Therapien zu gewinnen. Der Einsatz von LLM automatisiert die Datenextraktion und -strukturierung, wodurch eine schnelle und präzise Analyse großer Datenmengen ermöglicht wird. Dadurch werden Forschungsprozesse optimiert und die Entwicklung neuer medizinischer Behandlungsstrategien beschleunigt.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common diseases worldwide while current treatment options are not ideal. New therapeutic classes of migraine, the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, have been developed and shown considerable effectiveness and safety. The present study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of atogepant, a CGRP antagonist, for migraine prophylaxis from the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n",
      "METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed and https://www.\n",
      "CLINICALTRIALS: gov/ were searched for RCTs that compared atogepant with placebo for migraine prophylaxis from inception of the databases to Feb 1, 2024. Outcome data involving efficacy and safety were combined and analyzed using Review Manager Software version 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). For each outcome, risk ratios (RRs) or standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: 4 RCTs with a total of 2813 subjects met our inclusion criteria. The overall effect estimate showed that atogepant was significantly superior to placebo in terms of the reduction of monthly migraine (SMD - 0.40, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.34) or headache (SMD - 0.39, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.33) days, the reduction of acute medication use days (SMD - 0.45, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.39) and 50% responder rate (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.89), while no dose-related improvements were found between different dosage groups. For the safety, significant number of patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with atogepant than with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.21) while there was no obvious difference between the five dosage groups. Most TEAEs involved constipation (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.91-3.41), nausea (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.67-2.87) and urinary tract infection (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05-2.11). In addition, a high dosage of atogepant may also increase the risk of treatment-related TEAEs (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.02-2.63) and fatigue (RR 3.07, 95% CI 1.13-8.35).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that atogepant is effective and tolerable for migraine prophylaxis including episodic or chronic migraine compared with placebo. It is critical to weigh the benefits of different doses against the risk of adverse events in clinical application of atogepant. Longer and multi-dose trials with larger sample sizes are required to verify the current findings.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations of CM have a high impact on the quality of life of patients, and monoclonal antibodies such as fremanezumab are used as prophylactic treatment.\n",
      "METHODS: Diagnosed CM patients treated for at least 3 months with monthly fremanezumab were interviewed. The data to assess efficacy were before treatment and at the time of the interview: monthly headache days (MHDs), daily headache hours (DHHs), monthly symptomatic medication days (MSMDs), percentage of patients with symptomatic medication overuse (SMO), and pain intensity with the numerical rating scale (NRS) score. Possible predictors of reversion were analyzed: percentage of patients treated for at least 12 months, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, depression, anxiety, symptomatic control with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans or both, and amitriptyline prophylaxis.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were included, of whom 40 (74.1%) were converters to EM. There were significant improvements in converters compared to pre-treatment in MHDs (28.0 vs. 5.0 days), as well as on the variables DHHs, MSMDs, and SMO. The percentage of erenumab failures was significantly higher in non-converters than in converters, as was the percentage of patients with anxiety.\n",

      "RESULTS: In total, 1218 adult migraine patients (85.6% female, 40.2 ± 12.8 years, baseline MIDAS 44.2 ± 47.4, follow-up MIDAS 36.5 ± 45.3) were included. For patients with baseline MIDAS >20 (MIDAS grade IV, n = 757), different methods using PGIC \"somewhat improved\" as anchor yielded percent change MIDs of the MIDAS between -29.4% and -33.2%. For baseline MIDAS between 6 and 20 (grades II and III, n = 334), using PGIC \"much improved\" as anchor, difference change MIDs were between -3.5 and -4.5 points.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a recurrent, disabling neurological disorder with a substantial global disease burden. However, limited real-world data are available on the patient characteristics, treatment patterns, comorbidities, and economic burden of migraine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In this study, we evaluated the disease burden, comorbidities, treatment patterns, specialties involved in migraine diagnosis, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and associated costs in patients with migraine in Dubai, UAE.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective, secondary database cohort study was conducted from 01 January 2014 to 31 March 2022 using the Dubai Real-World Database. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with at least one diagnosis claim for migraine with continuous enrollment during the study period were included. Patients were stratified into treatment sub-cohorts. Outcomes were evaluated in terms of clinical characteristics, comorbidities, specialists visited, treatment patterns, and HCRU.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 203,222 patients (mean age: 40 years), with male predominance (55.4%). About 13.4% of patients had specific cardiovascular comorbidities. Frequently prescribed drug classes were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (84.4%), triptans (29.8%), and beta-blockers (12.8%), while only 1.0% of patients with migraine were prescribed newer medications like calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists. General medicine was the most frequently visited specialty on the index date (51.5%). The all-cause and migraine-specific median gross costs during the 12-month post-index period were US $1252.6 (2.4-564,740.7) and US $198.1 (0-168,903.3) respectively, with maximum contribution from inpatients. The contribution of migraine-specific median costs to all-cause median costs was highest for the diagnosis-related group (64.9%), followed by consumables (35.2%), medications (32.0%), procedures (24.5%), and services (24.5%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Migraine significantly impacts healthcare costs in the UAE. The role of newer therapies in migraine management should be explored to reduce the associated socioeconomic burden and improve patients' quality of life.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects a significant number of military personnel, primarily because of physical impact, vehicle incidents, and blast exposure. Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is the most common symptom reported following mild TBI and can persist for several years. However, the current International Classification of Headache Disorders lacks phenotypic characterization for this specific headache disorder. It is important to appropriately classify the headache sub-phenotypes as it may enable more targeted management approaches. This systematic review seeks to identify the most common sub-phenotype of headaches in military personnel with PTH attributed to mild TBI.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a systematic search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines, focusing on the military population. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched. Abstracts and full texts were independently reviewed by two authors using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed using a standardized form. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eight papers related to the military population were included in this review. Migraine was the most commonly reported headache sub-phenotype, with a prevalence ranging from 33 to 92%. Additionally, one military study identified tension-type headaches as the most prevalent headache phenotype. Although not the primary phenotype, one military cohort reported that approximately one-third of their cohort experienced trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, which were associated with exposure to blast injuries and prior concussions.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrated that PTH in the military population frequently exhibit migraine-like features. Tension-type headache and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias also occur, although less commonly reported. Sub-phenotyping PTH may be important for initiating effective treatment since different phenotypes may respond differently to medications. The study populations analyzed in this systematic review display heterogeneity, underscoring the necessity for additional research features, more stringent criteria and comprehensive recording of baseline characteristics. Characterizing headaches following injury is crucial for an accurate diagnosis to enable effective management and rehabilitation planning for our armed forces.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Nurtec, a versatile migraine medication, has gained popularity. However, the awareness of migraine surgery remains uncertain.\n",
      "METHODS: Following a descriptive approach, this cross-sectional study used Google Trends data as of December 1, 2023, to analyze internet search patterns. Approval from Vanderbilt University's institutional review board and adherence to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were confirmed. Monthly relative search volume (RSV) data for \"migraine surgery,\" \"Nurtec,\" and \"Rimegepant\" were collected from January 1, 2004, to November 11, 2023, within the United States. Statistical analysis involved determining mean monthly RSV values and percentage changes for critical periods.\n",
      "RESULTS: For \"Nurtec,\" a significant surge in RSV occurred from March 2020 to April 2020 (344%). Additional peaks were observed from June 2020 to July 2020 (66%), October 2020 to December 2020 (169%), May 2021 to June 2021 (33%), and May 2023 to June 2023 (14%). \"Migraine surgery\" exhibited a notable 400% increase in RSV, from March 2005 to May 2005. However, post-2006, RSV for \"migraine surgery\" consistently remained low without noticeable peaks.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of RSV trends for \"Nurtec\" and \"migraine surgery\" from 2004 to 2023 reveals the impact of pivotal events and marketing strategies on public interest. The distinct peaks in \"Nurtec\" RSV align with Food & Drug Administration approvals and marketing campaigns, highlighting the medication's accessibility. Conversely, the consistently low RSV for \"migraine surgery\" indicates limited awareness, emphasizing the need for enhanced promotion and education regarding surgical interventions.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To examine cerebral functional alterations associated with sensory processing in patients with migraine and constant photophobia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common headache disorder that presents with photophobia in many patients during attacks. Furthermore, some patients with migraine experience constant photophobia, even during headache-free intervals, leading to a compromised quality of life.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective, case-control study included 40 patients with migraine (18 male and 22 female) who were recruited at an eye hospital and eye clinic. The patients were divided into two groups: migraine with photophobia group, consisting of 22 patients (10 male and 12 female) with constant photophobia, and migraine without photophobia group, consisting of 18 patients (eight male and 10 female) without constant photophobia. We used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography to compare cerebral glucose metabolism between the two patient groups and 42 healthy participants (16 men and 26 women).\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with the healthy group, both the migraine with photophobia and migraine without photophobia groups showed cerebral glucose hypermetabolism in the bilateral thalamus (p < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected). Moreover, the contrast of migraine with photophobia minus migraine without photophobia patients showed glucose hypermetabolism in the bilateral medial thalamus (p < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The medial thalamus may be associated with the development of continuous photophobia in patients with migraine.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the prevalence of depression in disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), migraine, and stroke. Also, we detect risk factors for depression occurrence within each disorder. Moreover, we compare the risk factors in these four common neurologic disorders. In advance, we assess the three surveys in order to better comprehend their distinctions.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Depression is a globally prevalent Psychologic disorder and common co-morbidity in neurological diseases. However, it is mostly underdiagnosed in chronic patients and causes numerous adverse effects.\n",
      "METHODS: We used the database of neurology specialty clinics in a hospital in Tehran, the largest city of Iran. Five hundred nineteen patients, including 105 PD patients, 101 patients with stroke, 213 cases with MS, and 100 Migraine patients, were assessed. They were asked about their chief characteristics and disease-specific variables that may cause depression. Moreover, depression criteria were measured with three internationally used scales to study their variances.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of depression in PD, stroke, MS, and migraine, according to the BDI-II scale, were 43.8%, 38.6%, 45.1%, 37.6%, and according to HDRS scale, were 56.2%, 51.5%, 39.4%, and 43.6% respectively. Finally, according to DSM-XC the depression prevalence were 64.8%, 34.7%, 36.2%, and 67.3% respectively. Possible risk factors of depression were lower educational level, disease severity, socioeconomic level, marital or employment status, female gender, higher age, and consumption of some specific drugs.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Depression is a widespread disorder in chronic neurologic conditions. Our data suggests the odds of depression in neurologic disorders depend on the characteristics of the patient and the features of the disease.\n",

      "METHODS: The study included 172 participants aged 6 to 17 years (M = 13.09, SD = 3.02 years; 120 girls). Of these 80 participants were patients with migraine, 23 were patients with tension-type headache, and 69 were healthy controls. The following sensory measures were obtained: Mechanical Detection Threshold (MDT), Mechanical Pain Threshold (MPT), Mechanical Pain Sensitivity (MPS), detection and pain threshold for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), olfactory and intranasal trigeminal detection threshold, and odor identification ability. Sensory sensitivity was compared between groups with a series of Kruskal-Wallis tests. Binomial regression models were used to compare the relative utility of sensory sensitivity measures in classifying participants into patients and healthy controls, as well as into patients with migraine and tension-type headache.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with migraine had lower MPT measured at the forearm than patients with tension-type headaches and healthy controls. MPS was higher in patients with migraine than in healthy controls. All patients with headaches had lower detection threshold of TENS and higher olfactory sensitivity. Healthy controls showed increased intranasal trigeminal sensitivity. Scores in MPS, TENS, and olfactory and trigeminal thresholds were significantly predicting presence of primary headaches. Additionally, scores in MPT, olfactory and trigeminal threshold were positive predictors of type of headache.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Children with primary headaches exhibit different sensory profiles than healthy controls. The obtained results suggest presence of increased overall, multimodal sensitivity in children with primary headaches, what may negatively impact daily functioning and contribute to further pain chronification.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have investigated associations between gender, symptom resolution, and time to return to play following sport-related concussion (SRC). However, there is a notable gap in research regarding the association between gender and return to learn (RTL) in adolescents. Therefore, this study 1) compared the patterns of RTL between boys and girls who are high school student athletes, and 2) evaluated the possible association between gender and time to RTL after adjusting for covariates.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of a prospective surveillance program that monitored concussion recovery of athletes in high schools throughout the state of Maine between February 2015 and January 2023 was performed. The primary independent variable was gender, dichotomized as boys and girls. The primary outcome was time to RTL, defined by the number of days for an athlete to return to school without accommodations. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare RTL between the boys and girls. Each athlete's RTL status was dichotomized (i.e., returned vs had not returned) at several time points following injury (i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks), and chi-square tests were performed to compare the proportions who achieved RTL between groups. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive value of gender on RTL. Covariates included age, number of previous concussions, history of learning disability or attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, history of a psychological condition, history of headaches or migraines, initial Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3/SCAT5) score, and days to evaluation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 895 high school athletes, 488 (54.5%) were boys and 407 (45.5%) were girls. There was no statistically significant difference in median [IQR] days to RTL between genders (6.0 [3.0-11.0] vs 6.0 [3.0-12.0] days; U = 84,365.00, p < 0.375). A greater proportion of boys successfully returned to learn without accommodations by 3 weeks following concussion (93.5% vs 89.4%; χ2 = 4.68, p = 0.030), but no differences were found at 1, 2, or 4 weeks. A multivariable model predicting days to RTL showed that gender was not a significant predictor of RTL (p > 0.05). Longer days to evaluation (β = 0.10, p = 0.021) and higher initial SCAT3/SCAT5 scores (β = 0.15, p < 0.001) predicted longer RTL.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of high school athletes, RTL did not differ between boys and girls following SRC. Gender was not a significant predictor of RTL. Longer days to evaluation and higher initial symptom scores were associated with longer RTL.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the heavy metal and trace element (HMTE) profile in patients with migraine (PwM) and to compare it to that of healthy individuals without migraine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a universal disease that affects more than 10% of the world's population; however, its pathophysiology is still obscure.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 100 participants were included in this prospective matched case-control study (50 PwM during acute attack and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls). The study was conducted in the university hospital in Yozgat, Turkey, where the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system was used to measure the HMTE profile. The calibration curve was created with 11 points for heavy metals (arsenic [As], cadmium [Cd], cobalt [Co], lead [Pb], mercury [Hg], nickel [Ni], and tin [Sn]) and trace elements (antimony [Sb], chromium [Cr], copper [Cu], iron [Fe], magnesium [Mg], manganese [Mn], molybdenum [Mo], and zinc [Zn]).\n",
      "RESULTS: The median age was 27 (23-37) years, and the female/male ratio was 37/13 for both groups. The PwM group had significantly higher As, Co, Pb, and Ni levels among the heavy metals (p = 0.033, 0.017, 0.022, and 0.021, respectively). Also, PwM had significantly lower Cr, Mg, and Zn levels among the trace elements (p = 0.007, 0.024, and < 0.001, respectively). The only trace element that was elevated in the PwM group was Mn (p = 0.001). The PwM and control groups did not differ in terms of Cd, Sn, Sb, Cu, Fe, and Mo (p = 0.165, 0.997, 0.195, 0.408, 0.440, and 0.252, respectively).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Some HMTE parameters are altered in PwM, which may provide additional insight into understanding migraine etiology.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To describe treatment patterns and direct healthcare costs over 3 years following initiation of standard of care acute and preventive migraine medications in patients with migraine in the United States.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: There are limited data on long-term (>1 year) migraine treatments patterns and associated outcomes.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study using US claims data from the IBM® MarketScan® Research Database (January 2010-December 2017). Adults were included if they had a prescription claim for acute migraine treatments (AMT) or preventive migraine treatments (PMT) in the index period (January 2011-December 2014). The AMT cohort was categorized as persistent, cycled, or added-on subgroups; the PMT cohort was categorized PMT-persistent, switched without gaps, or cycled with gaps. Migraine-specific annual direct costs (2017 US$) across AMT and PMT cohort subgroups were summarized at baseline through 3 years from index (follow-up).\n",
      "RESULTS: During the index period, 20,778 and 42,259 patients initiated an AMT and a PMT, respectively. At the 3-year follow-up, migraine-specific direct costs were lower in the persistent subgroup relative to the non-persistent subgroups in both AMT (mean [SD]: $789 [$1741] vs. $2847 [$8149] in the added-on subgroup and $862 [$5426] for the cycled subgroup) and PMT cohorts (mean [SD]: $1817 [$5892] in the persistent subgroup vs. $4257 [$11,392] in the switched without gaps subgroup and $3269 [$18,540] in the cycled with gaps subgroup). Acute medication overuse was lower in the persistent subgroup (1025/6504 [27.2%]) vs. non-persistent subgroups (11,236/58,863 [32.2%] in cycled with gaps subgroup and 1431/6504 [39.4%] in the switched without gaps subgroup). Most patients used multiple acute (19,717/20,778 [94.9%]) or preventive (38,494/42,259 [91.1%]) pharmacological therapies over 3 years following treatment initiation. Gaps in preventive therapy were common; an average gap ranged from 85 to 211 days (~3-7 months).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Migraine-specific annual healthcare costs and acute migraine medication overuse remained lowest among patients with persistent AMT and PMT versus non-persistent treatment. Study findings are limited to the US population. Future studies should compare costs and associated outcomes between newer preventive migraine medications in patients with migraine.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and analyze subpopulations with age-matched controls.\n",
      "METHODS: T2-weighted MRI scans of 150 patients with SSNHL were assessed for WMHs and compared with the data of 148 healthy age-matched adults. Assessments of WMHs included independent grading of deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) and periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs). WMH severity was visually rated using the Fazekas and Mirsen scales by two independent observers.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fazekas grades for PVHs (p &lt; 0.001) and DWMHs (p &lt; 0.001) of SSNHL patients were found to be significantly greater than those of healthy participants. The average Mirsen grades for DWMHs of healthy and SSNHL patients were evaluated to be 0.373 ± 0.550 and 2.140 ± 0.859, respectively. Mirsen grades for DWMHs of SSNHL patients were found to be significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) than those of healthy participants. The Mirsen scale was found to have higher sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001) than the Fazekas scale in grading PVHs and DWMHs. No significant difference (p = 0.24) was found in specificities between the two scales.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sudden hearing loss have a much higher likelihood of having periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities compared to age-matched controls. These findings indicate that sudden hearing loss patients are more likely to have microvascular changes in the brain, which may indicate a vascular and/or migraine origin to sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n",

      "METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study from March 2014 to June 2021 evaluating children and adolescents who received a lidocaine or sodium valproate infusion for the treatment of status migrainosus. During the study period, lidocaine infusion was exclusively used before March 2016, whereas sodium valproate infusion was exclusively used afterward.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 31 patients received lidocaine and 63 received sodium valproate infusion. Patients in the lidocaine group achieved significantly faster control of pain with median hours to pain free of 11.7 (interquartile range, 3.8-32.3) hours compared with 43.4 (interquartile range 13.8-68.7) hours in the valproate group (P = .002). At discharge, 21 of 31 (67.7%) of patients receiving lidocaine were pain-free compared with 26 of 59 (44.1%) of patients receiving valproate (P = .03). There were significantly more infusion interruptions of valproate compared with lidocaine for various patient-related factors (16/63, 25.4% vs 1/31, 3.2%; P = .009). More adverse effects were observed with valproate (42/63, 67%) compared with lidocaine (1/31, 3.2%; P < .001). The significant difference in hours to pain control persisted after adjustment for sex, race, age, BMI, presence of comorbidities, and pain score at admission. All patients in both groups completed the infusions and were discharged from the hospital.\n",

      "METHODS: This multicenter study involved retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of CM patients treated with CGRP mAbs or onabotulinumtoxinA, including difficult-to-treat (DTT) patients (i.e., ≥3 preventive failures). Treatment outcomes were determined at 6 months based on prospective headache diaries and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS).\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 316 (55 M/261F, mean age 44.4 ± 13.5 years) and 333 (61 M/272F, mean age 47.9 ± 13.4 years) CM patients treated with CGRP mAbs or onabotulinbumtoxinA, respectively. At 6 months, CGRP mAb treatment was associated with a greater decrease in monthly migraine days (MMDs) (-13.0 vs. -8.7 days/month, p < 0.001) and a higher ≥50% responder rate (RR) (74.7% vs. 50.7%, p < 0.001) compared with onabotulinumtoxinA injections. The findings were consistent in DTT patients (-13.0 vs. -9.1 MMDs, p < 0.001; ≥50% RR: 73.9% vs. 50.3%, p < 0.001) or those with medication-overuse headache (MOH) (-13.3 vs. -9.0 MMDs, p < 0.001; ≥50% RR: 79.0% vs. 51.6%, p < 0.001). Besides, patients receiving CGRP mAbs had greater improvement (-42.2 vs. -11.8, p < 0.001) and a higher ≥50% RR (62.0% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.001) in MIDAS scores and a lower rate of adverse events (AEs) (6.0% vs. 21.0%, p < 0.001). However, none of the patients discontinued treatment due to AEs.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter, real-world study, CGRP mAbs were more effective than onabotulinumtoxinA in CM patients, even in DTT or MOH patients. All of these injectables were well tolerated. Further prospective studies are needed to verify these findings.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in patients who experience migraine and compare findings between adult male and female patients. Specific symptoms and comorbidities also were analyzed to determine whether they were associated with WMH prevalence or the sex of patients with migraine. We hypothesized that females would have a higher prevalence of WMHs, experience more frequent and more severe migraine headaches, and be more likely to have certain comorbidities associated with migraine than males.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: An increased prevalence of WMHs in patients with migraine has been proposed, although this relation is not well-supported by data from population-based MRI studies. The difference in brain morphology between males and females is of research interest, and females in the general population appear to have a higher prevalence of WMHs. Sex differences and various comorbidities in patients with migraine relative to the number of WMHs on brain imaging have not been fully investigated.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 177 patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of migraine who were seen in the Lehigh Valley Fleming Neuroscience Institute's Headache Center between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2017. Patients' baseline characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records, including demographics, review of systems documentation, and brain imaging from MRI. Variables including headache severity, frequency of head pain, insomnia, and comorbidities (anxiety, depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and neck pain) also were analyzed for associations with the presence of WMHs.\n",
      "RESULTS: Females were found to have a significantly higher number of WMHs than males (median 3 [IQR: 0-7] vs. 0 [IQR: 0-3], p = 0.023). Patients with WMHs were significantly more likely than those without WMHs to have hypertension (39.8% of patients with WMHs vs. 20.3% without WMHs, p = 0.011), constipation (20.9% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.034), and sleep disorder (55.7% vs. 37.3%, p = 0.022). Females with migraine were significantly more likely to experience constipation than males (20.0% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.015). None of the migraine characteristics studied (frequency, severity, presence of aura) were different between sexes, nor were they significantly associated with the presence of WMHs.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study suggests that females with migraine may be more likely to have WMHs and experience constipation than males with migraine. Migraine frequency and severity were not different between sexes, nor were they significantly associated with the presence of WMHs. The findings of this study do not support a specific etiology of WMH development in individuals with migraine that differs from findings in the general population. Further studies are warranted.\n",

      "METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at Golestan Hospital of Ahvaz, Iran, in 2021. A total of 60 patients with episodic migraine were randomly assigned into 2 groups of receiving 3 mg melatonin (intervention group; n=30) or the same dose of placebo (control group; n=30) along with baseline therapy (propranolol 20 mg, BID) for two months. The attack frequency, attack duration, attack severity (based on VAS), the number of analgesic intakes, drug complications, Migraine Disability Assessment score (MIDAS), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were evaluated at baseline and in the first, second, third, and fourth months of follow-up. The independent t test, chi-square, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures were used to compare variables between the two groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: In both groups, the frequency, duration, and severity of attacks, taking analgesics, MIDAS, and PSQI scores during follow-up decreased significantly (P<0.001). After treatment, the mean frequency (P=0.032) and duration of attacks (P=0.001), taking analgesic (P<0.001), and MIDAS (P<0.001) and PSQI scores (P<0.001) in the melatonin group were lower than placebo.

      "OBJECTIVES: The objective are to determine whether diphenhydramine coadministered with prochlorperazine versus prochlorperazine only is associated with a difference in the risk of migraine treatment failure, as measured by the need for additional therapy, hospitalization rates, and 72-hour return rates, and to compare extrapyramidal adverse effects between groups.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients aged 7 to 18 years treated in the emergency department for migraines using prochlorperazine with or without diphenhydramine between 2013 and 2019. Patients were included if they had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, codes for migraine or unspecified headache and were treated with prochlorperazine as part of their initial migraine therapy. Data collected included demographics, medications administered, pain scores, neuroimaging, disposition, return visits, and documentation of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between diphenhydramine coadministration and each of the outcomes.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 1683 patients were included. Overall, 13% required additional therapy with a 16.7% admission rate and a 72-hour return rate of 5.3%. There was no association between initial treatment with diphenhydramine and the odds of additional therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.74 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.53-1.03]), admission rates (aOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.89-1.67]), or return visit rates (aOR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.55-1.51]). Extrapyramidal adverse effects occurred in 2.4% of patients in the prochlorperazine group and 0% in the prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between diphenhydramine coadministration and the need for additional therapy, 72-hour return visit rates or admission rates. Extrapyramidal effects did not occur in patients treated with diphenhydramine.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) and vestibular migraine (VM) share symptoms of visual vertigo and motion sickness that can be confusing for clinicians to distinguish. We compare the severity of these symptoms and dynamic subjective visual vertical (dSVV) in these two common vestibular conditions.\n",
      "METHOD: Twenty-nine patients with PPPD, 37 with VM, and 29 controls were surveyed for subjective symptoms using the visual vertigo analogue scale (VVAS) and motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire during childhood (MSA) and the past 10 years (MSB). dSVV is a measure of visual dependence measures perception of verticality against a rotating background (5 deg./s).\n",
      "RESULTS: VVAS revealed contextual differences for dizziness between those with PPPD and VM. Ratings of visual vertigo were most severe in PPPD, less in VM, and mild in controls (VVAS PPPD 27.1, VM 11.2, control 4.6, p < 0.001). MSA was more severe in VM than in PPPD or control (12.8 vs 7.6 vs 8.5, p = 0.01). MSB was more severe in VM than controls (MSB score 12.9 VS 8.1 p = 0.009) but was not different than PPPD (MSB score 10.0, p = 0.10). dSVV alignment was similar among the three groups (p = 0.83). Both VM and PPPD groups had greater simulator sickness than controls after completing the dSVV.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PPPD report more visual vertigo than those with VM, but a history of motion sickness as a child is more common in VM. Additionally, the environmental context that induces visual vertigo is different between PPPD and VM.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Headache is an adverse event associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recently, migraine has emerged more specifically as a potential adverse event with PPI use. The objectives of this work were to capitalize on existing data to evaluate the association between migraine and severe headache prevalence and use of acid-suppression therapy, including PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and generic antacids; to compare risk from PPIs vs H2RAs; and to assess for potential mitigation by a dietary factor affected by acid-suppression therapy.\n",
      "METHODS: Data from adults in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used for this cross-sectional analysis. Acid-suppression therapy use was identified from self-report confirmed by product packaging review. Respondents who endorsed migraine or severe headache in the past 3 months were classified in the migraine or severe headache group. Dietary intake of magnesium was determined using one 24-hour recall interview. Multivariable logistic regression models were generated to analyze the relationship between acid-suppression therapy use and migraine or severe headache, and an interaction test was conducted to evaluate whether migraine or severe headache prevalence differed in relation to nutritional magnesium intake across acid-suppression therapy users and nonusers.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 11,818 US adults, the use of acid-suppression therapy was associated with higher odds of migraine or severe headache for all types of acid-suppression therapy and use of any type, as compared with those who did not use acid-suppression therapy: use of PPIs (70% higher), H2RAs (40% higher), and generic antacids (30% higher). Differences between acid-suppression therapy were not significant. An interaction was observed for H2RA use and magnesium intake (p = 0.024).\n",
      "DISCUSSION: These observations in US adults agree with previous findings that migraine or severe headache is a potential adverse event of PPIs, the most efficacious and most frequently used type of acid suppressing medication, and further suggest that other classes of acid suppressing medications (H2RAs and generic antacids) may also be implicated for migraine and severe headache. Future prospective analyses are needed to investigate migraine risk associated with acid suppressing medications while current evidence is sufficient to evaluate patients with migraine in light of recent deprescribing advice for PPIs.\n",

      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients with migraine (21-56 years old), were examined using a headache diary, MIDAS and VAS. A microbiological examination of saliva and smear from the mucosa of the posterior wall of the oropharynx with evaluation by the method of mass spectrometry of microbial markers (MSMM) with the determination of 57 microorganisms was performed. All patients had comorbid chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract (URT), according to anamnestic data and examination by specialists.\n",
      "RESULTS: A significant increase in the content of markers of resident (conditionally pathogenic) microorganisms characteristic of chronic diseases of URT (strepto- and staphylococci); markers of transient microorganisms characteristic of intestinal microflora (clostridia, gram-negative rods, anaerobes) that are normally absent; viral markers of cytomegaloviruses and herpes groups; a decrease in the content of fungi were identified in saliva. A comparative analysis of the microbiome of saliva and oropharynx showed: 1) a significant decrease in the concentration of coccal flora Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in saliva; enterobacteria Helicobacter pylori; gram-negative rods Kingella spp., fungi and Epstein-Barr virus; 2) an increase in salivary concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, anaerobic Clostridium ramosum and Fusobacterium spp./Haemophilus spp. and gram-negative bacilli Porphyromonas spp.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: A comparative assessment of the microbiota of a smear from the posterior wall of the oropharynx and saliva using MMSM showed the presence of dysbiosis both in the oropharynx and in the saliva of patients with migraine. However, there were fewer deviations from the norm in saliva, therefore, for diagnostic purposes, a smear from the posterior wall of the oropharynx is more significant as a biomarker for patients with migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Pediatric migraine prophylaxis is indicated when headaches are frequent and/or disabling. We aimed to conduct a study to compare the efficacy of cinnarizine and amitriptyline in pediatric migraine prophylaxis.\n",
      "METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, patients aged 4-17 years with migraine who were eligible for prophylaxis enrolled. The primary outcome was a reduction response rate of ≥50% with p &lt; 0.005 with respect to headache characteristics. The secondary outcome was migraine disability assessment. We evaluated patients every four weeks for three months: T1: week 4, T2: week 8 and T3: week 12. The safety profile was also assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomly assigned to each group. However, 43 patients completed the trial. Headache frequency decreased in amitriptyline group more effectively in T1 (p = 0.004). Amitriptyline was more successful in reducing the headache duration in all three periods (p &lt; 0.005). There was no significant difference in severity improvement and reducing disability score between the two groups (p &gt; 0.005). No serious adverse events were observed.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Both medications are effective in ameliorating migraine headaches and related disabilities. However, amitriptyline appears be a preferable option over cinnarizine, given its faster onset of action, efficacy in reducing headache duration and longer-lasting effects.Trial Registration: The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the code IRCT-20191112045413N1.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Insurers mandate step therapy with NOEPs before approving CGRP mAbs.\n",
      "METHODS: Databases were searched for class I or II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CGRP mAbs or NOEPs versus placebo for migraine prevention in adults. The primary outcome measure was monthly migraine days (MMD) or moderate to severe headache days.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twelve RCTs for CGRP mAbs, 5 RCTs for topiramate, and 3 RCTs for divalproex were included in the meta-analysis. There was high certainty that CGRP mAbs are more effective than placebo, with weighted mean difference (WMD; 95% confidence interval) of -1.64 (-1.99 to -1.28) MMD, which is compatible with small effect size (Cohen's d -0.25 [-0.34 to -0.16]). Certainty of evidence that topiramate or divalproex is more effective than placebo was very low and low, respectively (WMD -1.45 [-1.52 to -1.38] and -1.65 [-2.30 to -1.00], respectively; Cohen's d -1.25 [-2.47 to -0.03] and -0.48 [-0.67 to -0.29], respectively). Trial sequential analysis showed that information size was adequate and that CGRP mAbs had clear benefit versus placebo. Network meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between CGRP mAbs and topiramate (WMD -0.19 [-0.56 to 0.17]) or divalproex (0.01 [-0.73 to 0.75]). No significant difference was seen between topiramate or divalproex (0.21 [-0.45 to 0.86]).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: There is high certainty that CGRP mAbs are more effective than placebo, but the effect size is small. When feasible, CGRP mAbs may be prescribed as first-line preventives; topiramate or divalproex could be as effective but are less well tolerated. The findings of this study support the recently published 2024 position of the American Headache Society on the use of CGRP mAbs as the first-line treatment.\n",

      "METHODS: A total of 105 patients with migraine without aura were randomized into a combination group (35 cases, 5 cases dropped out), a thread-embedding group (35 cases, 4 cases dropped out) and a western medication group (35 cases, 2 cases dropped out). In the thread-embedding group, napex acupoint thread-embedding was applied at bilateral Fengchi (GB 20) and points of 1.5 cun nearby to the lower edge of spinous process of cervical 2. In the western medication group, metoprolol tartrate tablet was given orally, 12.5 mg a time, twice a day. In the combination group, napex acupoint thread-embedding combined with oral metoprolol tartrate tablet was delivered. The treatment of 8 weeks was required in the 3 groups. The days of headache attacks, frequency of headache attacks, headache severity (visual analogue scale [VAS] score) and the migraine specific quality of life questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ) score were observed during baseline period (4 weeks before treatment to before treatment), observation period (1-4 weeks and 5-8 weeks in treatment) and follow-up period (1-4 weeks after treatment completion) respectively, the proportions of the days of headache attacks/frequency of headache attacks relieved by 50% were calculated, and the safety was evaluated in the 3 groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: During the observation period and the follow-up period, the days of headache attacks, frequency of headache attacks and headache VAS scores in the 3 groups were reduced compared with those of the baseline period (P&lt;0.05). During the observation period and the follow-up period, the days of headache attacks and the frequency of headache attacks in the combination group were lower than those in the thread-embedding group and the western medication group (P&lt;0.05); during the observation period (1-4 weeks in treatment), the headache VAS scores in the combination group and the thread-embedding group were lower than that in the western medication group (P&lt;0.05); during the observation period (5-8 weeks in treatment) and the follow-up period, the headache VAS scores in the combination group were lower than those in the thread-embedding group and the western medication group (P&lt;0.05).

      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of concurrent anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and onabotulinumtoxinA (onabot) treatment on median monthly migraine days (MMD) in patients with chronic migraine, through a retrospective study.\n",
      "METHODS: The electronic medical records of Cleveland Clinic patients either concurrently (dual therapy) or consecutively (monotherapy) treated with anti-CGRP mAbs and onabot between June 2018 and November 2021 were extracted. Only adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) were included in this study. MMDs for 194 concurrently treated (86.6% female and a median [interquartile range] age of 51 [41-61] years) and 229 consecutively treated (88.2% female and median age of 47 [IQR 39-57] years) patients were examined at baseline, after first therapy of either anti-CGRP mAb or onabot, and following dual therapy for 3 consecutive months. The reduction of MMDs for each treatment group were compared. The same approach was utilized to compare consecutive monotherapy at separate times (n = 229) and dual-therapy groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: The initial treatment of the dual-therapy group reduced the median (IQR) MMDs from 30 (30-30) to 15 (12-30) [p < 0.0001]. After initiation of dual therapy, the median MMDs was further decreased from 15 (12-30) to 8 (3-22) [p < 0.0001]. A majority [132/194 (68.0%)] of the dual-therapy patients reported a ≥ 50% reduction in MMD and 90/194 (46.4%) reported a ≥ 75% reduction. For the consecutive monotherapy group, median MMDs changed from a baseline of 30 (25-30) to 15 (8-25) from onabot monotherapy and decreased from 25 (15-30) to 12 (4-25) after anti-CGRP mAb monotherapy. Almost half (113/229 [49.3%] from onabot, and 104/229 [45.4%] from anti-CGRP mAb) of these patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs and a minority (38/229 [16.6%] from onabot, and 45/229 [19.7%] from anti-CGRP mAb) achieved a reduction of ≥ 75%. Additionally, dual therapy showed significant improvement in MMDs compared with monotherapy of either treatment (p < 0.0001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Dual therapy of anti-CGRP mAbs and onabot may be more efficacious than monotherapy, possibly due to their synergistic mechanisms of action.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The Head Shake Sensory Organization Test (HS-SOT) assesses postural stability while the head is moving and may also identify deficits in attention associated with the dual task conditions of moving the head at a specified speed while maintaining balance. Normative values for the HS-SOT have not been established in a healthy military population or other highly trained populations such as athletes. Establishing normative values in a military population will enable clinicians to compare the scores of patients with medical conditions that affect postural stability and sensory integration such as concussion or traumatic brain injury, vestibular dysfunction, or migraine to those of a healthy population to determine a need for intervention and for return to duty considerations. The purposes of this cross-sectional study were to establish normative values for the HS-SOT within the military population, to determine whether HS-SOT scores differed between men and women or among age groups, and to determine whether HS-SOT scores differed from scores on similar conditions of the Sensory Organization Test (SOT).\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Active duty service members (n = 237, 54 female) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and the National Capitol Region (Washington, D.C, Maryland, and Virginia) completed the SOT and HS-SOT on the NeuroCom® Balance Master™. Parametric and non-parametric comparisons were analyzed for the equilibrium scores for the SOT and HS-SOT conditions 2 (SOT-2, HS-SOT-2, respectively) and 5 (SOT-5, HS-SOT-5, respectively) and the equilibrium score ratios (ESRs) for HS-SOT-2 and HS-SOT-5 for the total sample, men and women, and age group categories (18-26 years, 27-35 years, and 36-45 years).\n",
      "RESULTS: There were no differences in HS-SOT-2 or HS-SOT-5 equilibrium ratio scores between men (0.99 ±.029 and 0.83 ±0.25, respectively) and women (1.00 ±0.03 and 0.81 ±0.21, respectively). There were no differences in the SOT-2 equilibrium scores (F = 2.29, P = 0.10) or SOT-5 equilibrium scores (Kruskal-Wallis H = 3.26, P = 0.20) among the different age groups. SOT-2 equilibrium scores were higher than the HS-SOT-2 equilibrium scores (Z = -4.10, P < 0.001). SOT-5 equilibrium scores were also higher than HS-SOT-5 equilibrium scores (Z = -12.22, P < 0.001), and the HS-SOT-2 and HS-SOT-5 equilibrium scores differed from each other (Z = -13.26, P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study established normative values for the HS-SOT in a military population. Equilibrium scores did not differ between men and women or among age groups, suggesting that these values can be used as reference points for most service members. Postural stability was found to be significantly challenged during head motion, indicating the HS-SOT is a valuable tool for identifying subtle impairments in postural stability.

      "IMPORTANCE: Patients with migraine often cycle through multiple nonspecific preventive medications due to poor tolerability and/or inadequate efficacy leading to low adherence and increased disease burden.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, tolerability, patient adherence, and patient satisfaction between erenumab and nonspecific oral migraine preventive medications (OMPMs) in patients with episodic migraine (EM) who had previously failed 1 or 2 preventive treatments.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The 12-month prospective, interventional, global, multicenter, active-controlled, randomized clinical trial comparing sustained benefit of 2 treatment paradigms (erenumab qm vs oral prophylactics) in adult episodic migraine patients (APPRAISE) trial was a 12-month open-label, multicenter, active-controlled, phase 4 randomized clinical trial conducted from May 15, 2019, to October 1, 2021. This pragmatic trial was conducted at 84 centers across 17 countries. Overall, participants 18 years or older with a 12-month or longer history of migraine, and 4 or more but fewer than 15 monthly migraine days (MMDs) were included.\n",
      "INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive erenumab or OMPMs. Dose adjustment was permitted (label dependent).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of patients completing 1 year of the initially assigned treatment and achieving a reduction of 50% or greater from baseline in MMDs at month 12. Secondary end points included the cumulative mean change from baseline in MMDs during the treatment period and the proportion of responders according to the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale at month 12 for patients taking the initially assigned treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 866 patients were screened, of whom 245 failed the screening and 621 completed the screening and baseline period. Of the 621 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 41.3 [11.2] years; 545 female [87.8%]; 413 [66.5%] in the erenumab group; 208 [33.5%] in the OMPM group), 523 (84.2%) completed the treatment phase, and 98 (15.8%) discontinued the study. At month 12, significantly more patients assigned to erenumab vs OMPM achieved the primary end point (232 of 413 [56.2%] vs 35 of 208 [16.8%]; odds ratio [OR], 6.48; 95% CI, 4.28-9.82; P <.001). Compared with OMPMs, treatment with erenumab showed higher responder rate (314 of 413 [76.0%] vs 39 of 208 [18.8%]; OR, 13.75; 95% CI, 9.08-20.83; P <.001) on the PGIC scale (≥5 at month 12). Significant reduction in cumulative average MMDs was reported with erenumab treatment vs OMPM treatment (-4.32 vs -2.65; treatment difference [SE]: -1.67 [0.35] days; P < .001). Substantially fewer patients in the erenumab arm compared with the OMPM arm switched medication (9 of 413 [2.2%] vs 72 of 208 [34.6%]) and discontinued treatment due to adverse events (12 of 408 [2.9%] vs 48 of 206 [23.3%]). No new safety signals were identified.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that earlier use of erenumab in patients with EM who failed 1 or 2 previous preventive treatments provided greater and sustained efficacy, safety, and adherence than continuous OMPM.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacologic prophylactic methods for chronic migraine have been developed, including the promising non-invasive techniques of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). This study aimed to compare the efficacy of rTMS and tDCS on pain intensity, the impact of headaches on daily life, anxiety, and depression in migraine headaches patients.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 72 patients with migraine headaches, randomly allocated to the rTMS and tDCS groups. Participants received 3 and 12 sessions of stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. Follow-up measurements, including pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and impact on daily life, were performed one month after the last sessions. Analyses were done by IBM SPSS statistics version 26 software.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 72 patients enrolled in the study, 19 were male (8 in the rTMS group and 11 in the tDCS group). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between groups. During the follow-up visit, both groups showed a decrease in anxiety levels (P values = 0.005 and 0.015), while only the rTMS group displayed a significant improvement in depression (P value = 0.01). However, no statistically significant difference was found among the groups regarding changes in pain intensity, anxiety, and the impact of headaches on daily life (P values &gt;0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that both rTMS and tDCS may be effective in reducing pain intensity and improving the impact of headaches on daily life and anxiety in patients with chronic migraine. However, significant improvement in depression was only observed in the rTMS group patients.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Migraine is a common neurological disorder, which resulting in significant societal and personal burdens. Acupuncture has attracted widespread attention in migraine prophylaxis and treatment in recent years. Although some studies have confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy in treating migraines, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluation regarding the comparison between different types of migraines and various acupuncture therapies. Furthermore, certain special acupuncture methods have not received sufficient attention and research. Therefore, the objective of this study is to summarize and expand upon previous research, update existing evidence, and compare the efficacy of different acupuncture therapies for migraine. We aim to provide stronger evidence-based support for clinical practice through this study, thereby promoting wider application of acupuncture therapy in migraine treatment.\n",
      "METHODS: A exhaustive and methodical search was conducted across the nine databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, WANFANG and VIP Data. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, migraine attack frequency, duration, days of attack and adverse effects were observation indicators.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study included 34 studies involving a total of 3365 migraineurs. The results of the study demonstrated that acupuncture therapy reduced VAS scores of migraine patients better compared to medication (MD=-1.29, 95% CI=[-1.67,-0.92]) and exhibited greater efficacy in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (MD=-1.95, 95% CI=[-3.06,-0.85]), the duration of attacks (MD=- 3.29, 95% CI=[-4.65,-1.93]), and days of attack (MD=-1.02, 95% CI=[-1.58,-0.47]). Significant heterogeneity suggested that different acupuncture therapies had varying effects, and that the efficacy of the same therapy may also vary in different migraine types. In the context of network meta-analysis, the SUCRA of acupuncture therapies for reducing VAS scores was ranked as special acupuncture method (98.3%), acupuncture plus medicine (71.9%), and acupuncture (54.5%). Blood-letting and cupping was the most effective treatment for lowering the frequency of migraine attacks. The most effective treatment for shortening the duration of migraine was acupuncture plus medication (81.2%). When it comes to decreasing the days of migraine, acupuncture (80.3%) came out on top. 14 studies reported the occurrence of adverse effects, of which 4 studies had no adverse effects in the test group.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Initial findings indicate that acupuncture-related therapy exhibits superior effectiveness in the treatment of migraine and clinical decision-making should be patient-specific.\n",

      "METHODS: A Cross sectional study was adopted to evaluate the musculoskeletal profile in patients with chronic migraine and with chronic tension type headache. The Bio photogrammetric evaluation was performed using the postural assessment software PAS/SAPO, while unilateral passive accessory intervertebral motion (PAIM<sub>s</sub>) were applied for manual examinations of spine segments from C0 to L5 vertebra. The One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare the three groups with the software GraphPad InStat 3.06.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were recruited, 20 for chronic tension type group, 20 for chronic migraine group and 20 healthy controls. The most interesting findings was that patients with chronic primary headaches presented postural alterations in all parameters (cranio-vertebral angle and lumbar-pelvic angle) and musculoskeletal dysfunctions in all spine with respect to healthy controls. Finally, the most clinically relevant finding was that no differences were found between chronic migraine and chronic tension type headache concerning the postural alterations nor the musculoskeletal dysfunctions.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The sensitization acts as a substrate or consequence of these musculoskeletal dysfunctions in chronic primary headache. Therefore, non-pharmacological treatments targeted in the musculoskeletal system may be a good option in the management of chronic primary headache, especially when these therapies integrate various techniques that involve all spine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity has been proposed as a link. Previous studies have evaluated cerebrovascular reactivity with different methodologies and results are conflicting.\n",
      "METHODS: In this single-center, observational, case-control study, we included 31 interictal patients with migraine without aura (aged 19-66 years, 17 females) and 31 controls (aged 22-64 years, 18 females) with no history of vascular disease. Global and regional cerebrovascular reactivities were assessed with a dual-echo arterial spin labeling (ASL) 3.0 T MRI scan of the brain which measured the change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal to inhalation of 5% carbon dioxide.\n",
      "RESULTS: When comparing patients with migraine to controls, cerebrovascular reactivity values were similar between the groups, including mean gray matter CBF-based cerebrovascular reactivity (3.2 ± 0.9 vs 3.4 ± 1% ΔCBF/mmHg CO<sub>2</sub> ; p = 0.527), mean gray matter BOLD-based cerebrovascular reactivity (0.18 ± 0.04 vs 0.18 ± 0.04% ΔBOLD/mmHg CO<sub>2</sub> ; p = 0.587), and mean white matter BOLD-based cerebrovascular reactivity (0.08 ± 0.03 vs 0.08 ± 0.02% ΔBOLD/mmHg CO<sub>2</sub> ; p = 0.621).There was no association of cerebrovascular reactivity with monthly migraine days or migraine disease duration (all analyses p &gt; 0.05).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: DHE is an effective acute migraine treatment; however, self-administration difficulties have prevented its broader role in the management of migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: This randomized, active-controlled, five-period crossover study was conducted over 5 weeks separated by 1-week washout periods. Three STS101 dosage strengths (5.2, 7.0, 8.6 mg), and one dose each of LNS DHE 2.0 mg, and IM DHE 1.0 mg, were administered to 36 healthy participants. Liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine DHE (including its 8'OH-DHE metabolite) plasma levels and to calculate PK parameters (C<sub>max</sub> , T<sub>max</sub> , AUC<sub>0-2h</sub> , AUC<sub>0-last</sub> , AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> , and t<sub>1/2</sub> ). Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, nasal examinations, and laboratory parameters.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty-six participants (mean age 36 years; 19% Hispanic Black and 81% Hispanic White) were enrolled. DHE plasma concentrations rose rapidly after STS101 5.2, 7.0, and 8.6 mg and IM DHE injection, with mean concentrations greater than 2000 pg/mL for all STS101 dose strengths at 20 min. All STS101 dose strengths showed approximately 3-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> , AUC<sub>0-2h</sub> , and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> , than the LNS DHE. The mean AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> of STS101 7.0 and 8.6 mg were comparable to IM DHE (12,600 and 13,200 vs. 13,400 h × pg/mL). All STS101 dose strengths showed substantially lower variability (CV%) compared to LNS DHE for C<sub>max</sub> (35%-41% vs. 87%), and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> (37%-46% vs. 65%). STS101 was well tolerated, and all treatment-emergent AEs were mild and transient.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: STS101 showed rapid absorption and was well tolerated with mild and transient treatment-emergent AEs. Achieving effective DHE plasma concentrations within 10 min, STS101 displayed a favorable PK profile relative to the LNS with higher C<sub>max</sub> , AUC<sub>0-2h</sub> , and AUC<sub>0inf</sub> , and with greater response consistency. The AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> was comparable to IM DHE.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disabling neurologic disease that can fluctuate over time in severity, frequency, and acute medication use. Harris Poll Migraine Report Card was a US population-based survey to ascertain quantifiable distinctions amongst individuals with current versus previous high-frequency headache/migraine and acute medication overuse (HFM+AMO). The objective of this report is to compare self-reported experiences in the migraine journey of adults with HFM+AMO to those who previously experienced HFM+AMO but currently have a sustained reduction in headache/migraine frequency and acute medication use.\n",
      "METHODS: An online survey was available to a general population panel of adults (≥18 years) with migraine per the ID Migraine™ screener. Respondents were classified into \"current HFM+AMO\" (within the last few months had ≥8 headache days/month and ≥10 days/month of acute medication use; n=440) or \"previous HFM+AMO\" (previously had HFM+AMO, but within the last few months had ≤7 headache days/month and ≤9 days/month of acute medication use; n=110). Survey questions pertained to demographics, diagnosis, living with migraine, healthcare provider (HCP) communication, and treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: Participants in the current HFM+AMO group had 15.2 monthly headache days and 17.4 days of monthly acute medication use in last few months compared to 4.2 and 4.1 days for the previous HFM+AMO group, respectively. Overall, current preventive pharmacologic treatment use was low (15-16%; P>0.1 for current vs previous) in both groups. Previous HFM+AMO respondents reported better current acute treatment optimization. More respondents with current (80%) than previous HFM+AMO (66%) expressed concern with their current health (P<0.05). More than one-third of both groups wished their HCP better understood their mental/emotional health (current 37%, previous 35%; P>0.1 for current vs previous) and 47% (current) to 54% (previous) of respondents worried about asking their HCP too many questions (P>0.1 for current vs previous).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Apart from optimization of acute medication, medical interventions did not significantly differentiate between the current and previous HFM+AMO groups. Use of preventive pharmacological medication was low in both groups. Adults with current HFM+AMO more often had health concerns, yet both groups expressed concerns of disease burden. Optimization of acute and preventive medication and addressing mental/emotional health concerns of patients are areas where migraine care may impact outcomes regardless of their disease burden.\n",

      "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dang-Gui-Si-Ni (DGSN) decoction is a classic prescription in the clinical practice of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). DGSN decoction is often used to relieve symptoms of cold coagulation and blood stasis recorded by Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Shang Han Lun) and treat Raynaud's disease, dysmenorrhea, arthritis, migraine in TCM clinic. Accumulated evidences have suggested that this diseases are related to microcirculation disturbance. However, the anticoagulant activity and underlying mechanisms of DGSN decoction responsible for the therapeutic not well understood.\n",
      "AIM OF THE STUDY: The fingerprint and anticoagulant activity in vivo-in vitro of DGSN decoction were evaluated to strengthen the quality control and activity study of formulas.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical components of DGSN decoction were analyzed by HPLC and its fingerprint similarity were evaluated by \"Chinese Medicine Chromatographic Fingerprint Similarity Evaluation Software (2012 Edition)\". The anticoagulant activity of DGSN decoction was assessed by measuring four coagulation factors (PT, TT, APTT, FIB) in vitro. Zebrafish thrombosis model induced by punatinib was established to evaluate the activity of improving microvascular hemodynamics in vivo. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) were adopted to compare the changes in the RNA expression levels of coagulation factor II (FII), VII (FVII), IX (FIX) and X (FX) in zebrafish thrombosis model.\n",
      "RESULTS: The fingerprint similarity evaluation method of DGSN decoction was established. The results showed that 18 samples had higher similarity (S1-S18 &gt; 0.878). Pharmacodynamic results showed that DGSN decoction could extend PT, TT and APTT, and reduce FIB content in vitro. Meanwhile, it markedly enhanced the cardiac output and blood flow velocity at low dosage (500 μg mL-1) in vivo. q-PCR data demonstrated that DGSN decoction (500 μg mL-1) could downregulate the RNA expression of FII, FVII, FIX and FX. Interestingly, there were a bidirectional regulation of FII, FIX and FX in a certain concentration range. In general, DGSN decoction can significantly improve hemodynamics and downregulate coagulation factors, and the results were consistent both in vitro - in vivo.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The fingerprint study provide a new perspective for improving the quality control of DGSN decoction. DGSN decoction possess anticoagulant activity by regulating multiple coagulation factors simultaneously. Thus, it has the potential to develop into the novel raw material of anticoagulant drugs.\n",

      "METHODS: We searched four electronic databases from database inception to August 31, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that report efficacy and safety for the acute treatment of migraine. The risk of bias in the included RCTs was evaluated according to the Cochrane tool, and the certainty of evidence using the CINeMA approach. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses (NMA) to summarise the evidence. Data were analyzed using R-4.3.1.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 18 eligible studies including 10 different types of interventions with 22,429 migraine patients were included. NMA results showed that compared to ubrogepant (25 mg and 50 mg) and zavegepant, lasmiditan (100 mg and 200 mg) exhibits an elevated probability of achieving pain relief within a 2-hour interval. Similarly, relative to zavegepant, rimegepant (75 mg) and ubrogepant (50 mg and 100 mg) demonstrate an enhanced likelihood of sustaining pain relief over a 24-hour period. Furthermore, in contrast to ubrogepant (25 mg) and lasmiditan (50 mg), rimegepant (75 mg) presents a heightened probability of achieving freedom from photophobia within 2 h. Regarding safety, lasmiditan carries the highest risk of adverse events, which are associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects, including dizziness, somnolence, asthenia, paresthesia, and fatigue.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this NMA, a spectrum of evidence ranging from very low to high levels underscores the favorable efficacy and tolerability of rimegepant 75 mg and ubrogepant 100 mg, positioning them as potential candidates for the acute management of migraine. Concurrently, lasmiditan (100 mg and 200 mg) exhibits notable efficacy, albeit accompanied by an increased susceptibility to adverse events. These findings should still be approached with caution, primarily due to the intrinsic limitations associated with indirect comparisons.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling condition with high prevalence in the general population. Until the recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (Anti-CGRP mAbs), OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) was the only treatment specifically approved for CM prophylaxis. Direct comparisons between the two treatments are not available so far.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective, multicenter study in Italy to compare the real-world effectiveness of Anti-CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A. Patients with CM who had received either treatment according to Italian prescribing regulations were extracted from available clinical databases. Efficacy outcomes included the change from baseline in monthly headache days (MHD), MIgraine Disability ASsessment test (MIDAS), and monthly acute medications (MAM) evaluated at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The primary outcome was MHD change from baseline at 12 months. Safety outcomes included serious adverse events (SAE) and treatment discontinuation. Unadjusted and adjusted models were used for the analyses.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen potentially eligible patients were screened; 183 (86 Anti-CGRP mAbs; 97 BoNT-A) were included. One hundred seventy-one (80 Anti-CGRP mAbs; 91 BoNT-A) and 154 (69 Anti-CGRP mAbs; 85 BoNT-A) patients were included in the efficacy analysis at 6 and 12 months of follow-up, respectively. Anti-CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A both resulted in a mean MHD reduction at 6 (-11.5 and -7.2 days, respectively; unadjusted mean difference -4.3; 95%CI -6.6 to -2.0; p = 0.0003) and 12 months (-11.9 and -7.6, respectively; unadjusted mean difference -4.4; 95%CI -6.8 to -2.0; p = 0.0002) of follow-up. Similar results were observed after adjusting for baseline confounders. Anti-CGRP mAbs showed a significant MIDAS (-31.7 and -19.2 points, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0296, respectively) and MAM reduction (-5.1 and -3.1 administrations, p = 0.0023 and p = 0.0574, respectively) compared to BoNT-A at 6 and 12 months. No SAEs were reported. One patient receiving fremanezumab discontinued treatment due to arthralgia. Treatment discontinuations, mainly for inefficacy, were comparable.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Both Anti-CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A were effective in CM patients with Anti-CGRP mAbs presenting higher effect magnitude, with comparable safety. Still, BoNT-A remains a valuable option for CM patients with contraindications to Anti-CGRP mAbs or for frail categories who are candidates to local therapy with limited risk of systemic administration.\n",

      "PURPOSE: Some systemic medications are reported to be associated with dry eye disease (DED), yet their associations with the severity of DED signs and symptoms are not well studied. To evaluate these associations, we performed a secondary analysis of data from the DRy Eye Assessment and Management (DREAM) Study.\n",
      "METHODS: Participants (N = 535) were assessed for DED signs using tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer testing, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), and tear osmolarity and DED symptoms using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). We derived a composite signs severity score from the 6 DED signs and categorized participant-reported systemic medications into antidepressants, antihistamines, aspirin, corticosteroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, statins, vitamin D3, and medications for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, migraine, and seizure. Generalized linear models were used to compare DED symptom and sign scores between medication users and non-users, with adjustment for factors associated with DED severity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared to non-users, antihistamine users had lower TBUT (p = 0.01) and higher OSDI score (p = 0.02); aspirin users had lower TBUT (p = 0.02); corticosteroid users had lower TBUT (p = 0.02), lower Schirmer test scores (p = 0.03), higher cornea fluorescein staining (p = 0.01), higher composite severity score (p = 0.01), and higher OSDI score (p = 0.03); seizure medication users had higher composite severity score (p = 0.02); vitamin D3 users had lower TBUT (p = 0.001) and greater MGD (p = 0.03); and diuretic users had less MGD (p = 0.03).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Certain systemic medications may be associated with more severe DED. This may guide prescription practices in patients with DED.\n",

A representative cohort of Dutch patients with migraine (n = 5176) and the Dutch general population (n = 8370) was included. Patients with migraine were subdivided into episodic (EM) and chronic migraine (CM).

      "RESULTS: Included patients with migraine were 83.4% female (4319/5176) and had a mean (standard deviation) age of 44.8 (11.3) years. Patients with migraine reported less illicit drug use (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.55; p < 0.001), less current and lifetime smoking (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55-0.65; p < 0.001 and OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.79; p < 0.001), and less current alcohol consumption (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.62-0.70; p < 0.001) compared with the general population. Prevalence of substance use was compared between CM and EM participants and showed higher illicit drug use (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.11-2.69; p = 0.011), higher current smoking (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.11; p < 0.001) but less alcohol use (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43-0.68; p < 0.001) for participants with CM compared with EM.

All patients were interviewed and tested with psychometric methods. Socio-demographic and clinical-psychological characteristics were determined in all patients. The psychiatrist assessed the mental status of patients and diagnosed comorbid mental disorders according to the ICD-10 criteria.\n",
      "RESULTS: Symptoms of depression, high levels of trait and state anxiety, and a tendency to emotional inadequacy of response were more common in CM patients than in EM patients (p&lt;0.05). Mental disorders, predominantly of the anxiety-depressive spectrum, were more common in CM patients than EM patients (OR (95% CI)=2.54 (2.03 to 2.98, p&lt;0.001). Seventy-five percent of CM patients had more than one psychiatric diagnosis, almost a quarter of CM patients had schizotypal disorder, which is significantly higher than in EM patients (OR (95% CI)=1.99; 1.03 to 2.42, p&lt;0.001). There were more unmarried, single (without constant partner), unemployed, high-education patients in the CM group than in the EM group. The negative impact of headache on the daily activity of patients was significantly higher in the CM group than in the EM group (p&lt;0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Mental disorders and psychological features (anxiety, depression symptoms, a tendency to emotional inadequacy of response) are more common in CM patients than in EM patients. The presence of these factors may contribute to the chronification of migraine.\n",

We used available electronic health records (EHRs) to describe the use of medications during the first trimester in pregnant women and to compare drug exposure between those women who had an abortion (either elective or spontaneous) compared to those who had live births.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case-control study of abortions, either elective or spontaneous (cases), and live birth pregnancies (controls) in Sistema d'Informació per al Desenvolupament de la Investigació en Atenció Primària (Catalan Primary Health electronic health records) from 2012 to 2020. Exposure to drugs during first trimester of pregnancy was considered to estimate the association with abortion by conditional logistic regression and adjusted by health conditions and other drugs exposure.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty thousand three hundred fifty episodes of abortions were matched to 118,085 live birth pregnancy episodes. Cases had higher rates of alcohol intake (9.9% vs. 7.2%, p &lt; 0.001), smoking (4.5% vs. 3.6%, p &lt; 0.001), and previous abortions (9.9% vs. 7.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Anxiety (30.3% and 25.1%, p &lt; 0.001), respiratory diseases (10.6% and 9.2%, p &lt; 0.001), and migraine (8.2% and 7.3%, p &lt; 0.001), for cases and controls, respectively, were the most frequent baseline conditions. Cases had lower rate of drug exposure, 40,148 (66.5%) versus 80,449 (68.1%), p &lt; 0.001. Association with abortion was found for systemic antihistamines (adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adj</sub>] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.27), antidepressants (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.17), anxiolytics (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1.31, 95% CI 1.26-1.73), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR<sub>adj</sub> 1. 63, 95% CI 1.59-1.67).\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the treatment patterns among patients with migraine initiating galcanezumab, fremanezumab, and erenumab.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective study included adult patients with one or more claims for a self-injectable CGRP mAb (galcanezumab, fremanezumab, or erenumab), with continuous enrollment in medical and pharmacy benefits for 12 months pre-index and 6 and 12 months post-index using MerativeTM MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare databases from May 2017 through March 2021. Propensity-score matching was used to address confounding by observed covariates. Outcomes analyzed included proportion of days covered (PDC), medication-possession ratio (MPR), persistence (≤60-day gap), treatment discontinuation, and switch to a non-index drug. Descriptive X2 and t-test analyses were conducted.\n",
      "RESULTS: At the 12-month follow-up, matched galcanezumab and fremanezumab cohorts each comprised 2674 patients and the galcanezumab and erenumab cohorts 3503 each. The mean (SD) PDC and MPR were both 0.6 (0.3) across all cohorts.

      "METHODS: This study used the administrative claim database provided by DeSC Healthcare, Inc., that was linked to the results of an online survey administered to adult users of the health app \"kencom®.\" The ability of the 12 algorithms to detect migraines using diagnostic records alone or with prescription records was evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs). We used a migraine diagnosis judged based on respondents' self-reported symptoms according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, version 3 (ICHD-3), as true.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 21,480 individuals, 691 had migraine according to the ICHD-3 criteria. The 12 algorithms had a sensitivity of 5.4-8.8%, specificity of 98.8-99.6%, PPVs of 19.2-32.5%, and NPVs of 96.9-97.0%. Algorithm 9 (migraine diagnostic records more than once AND at least one prescription record for migraine prophylaxis or triptans in the same month as diagnosis) produced the highest PPV, whereas Algorithm 2 (at least one diagnostic record of migraine or tension-type headache) had the highest sensitivity. Similar trends were observed when using the ID-Migraine or 4-item migraine screener, instead of the ICHD-3 criteria, for case ascertainment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Strict algorithms, such as Algorithm 9, yielded a higher PPV but a lower sensitivity, and such algorithms may be suitable for studies estimating the relative risk. Conversely, algorithms based on a single diagnostic record, such as Algorithm 2, had a higher sensitivity and may be suitable for studies estimating the prevalence/incidence of disease. Our findings will help select a desirable algorithm for migraine studies using a Japanese claim database.\n",

Recently, such anti-epileptic drugs as Levetiracetam have been used to treat adult migraines. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of Levetiracetam, Sodium Valproate, and Propranolol in preventing migraine headaches in children.\n",
      "MATERIALS & METHODS: In this clinical trial, children with migraine were randomly divided into three groups. Each group consisted of 13 children. Two groups were treated with Propranolol and Sodium Valproate, respectively. Another group (the case) was treated with Levetiracetam. The patients were assessed based on headache score, PedMIDAS, and headache frequency before and three months after the intervention. Finally, the data was analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods.\n",
      "RESULTS: Levetiracetam significantly reduced the headache severity (P=0.026), frequency (P=0.024), and PedMIDAS score (P=0.001) in children with migraine. However, no significant difference was found between the three groups. The percentage of patients who experienced pain relief was detected as 69.24%, 92.31%, and 30.76% in the Propranolol, Sodium Valproate, and Levetiracetam groups, respectively.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is the world's second most common disabling disorder, affecting 15% of UK adults and costing the UK over £1.5 billion per year. Several costly new drugs have been approved by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.\n",
      "AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of drugs used to treat adults with chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: We did a systematic review of placebo-controlled trials of preventive drugs for chronic migraine. We then assessed the cost-effectiveness of the currently prescribable drugs included in the review: Onabotulinum toxin A (BTA), Eptinezumab (100mg or 300mg), Fremanezumab (monthly or quarterly dose), Galcanezumab or Topiramate, each compared to placebo, and we evaluated them jointly. We developed a Markov (state-transition) model with a three-month cycle length to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the different medications from a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. We used a two-year time horizon with a starting age of 30 years for the patient cohort. We estimated transition probabilities based on monthly headache days using a network meta-analysis (NMA) developed by us, and from published literature. We obtained costs from published sources and applied discount rates of 3.5% to both costs and outcomes.\n",
      "RESULTS: Deterministic results suggest Topiramate was the least costly option and generated slightly more QALYs than the placebo, whereas Eptinezumab 300mg was the more costly option and generated the most QALYs. After excluding dominated options, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between BTA and Topiramate was £68,000 per QALY gained and the ICER between Eptinezumab 300mg and BTA was not within plausible cost-effectiveness thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier showed that Topiramate is the most cost-effective medication for any amount the decision maker is willing-to-pay per QALY.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Among the various prophylactic medications for managing chronic migraine, only Topiramate was within typical cost-effectiveness threshold ranges. Further research is needed, ideally an economic evaluation alongside a randomised trial, to compare these newer, expensive CGRP MAbs with the cheaper oral medications.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis aims to assess the efficacy of transesophageal ultrasound-guided patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure in treating migraine in adolescents and compare the therapeutic outcomes of PFO closure for migraine with and without aura.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 86 cases of adolescents (12-20 years old) who underwent PFO closure for migraine at our institution over the past 3 years. The efficacy was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS), headache impact test (HIT)-6, and pediatric migraine disability assessment (PedMIDAS) scores, as well as by assessing the monthly frequency of migraine attacks, duration of each attack, and overall migraine burden. The patients were divided into two groups: an aura group (55 cases) and a non-aura group (31 cases) to investigate difference in therapeutic efficacy between the groups. The effect of residual shunt on migraine burden was assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 86 patients, 46 (54%) experienced complete remission of migraine, while 71 (83%) achieved a >50% reduction in migraine burden during the one-year follow-up period. Patients in the aura group showed more significant improvements in VAS, HIT-6, and PedMIDAS scores, as well as in monthly migraine attack frequency, duration of each attack, and overall migraine burden, than patients in the non-aura group. Moreover, patients with residual shunt did not exhibit statistically significant differences in therapeutic efficacy compared to patients with complete closure.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: PFO closure can effectively alleviate migraine symptoms in adolescents with migraine with concomitant PFO. The therapeutic efficacy is particularly pronounced for migraine with aura. Furthermore, minor levels of residual shunt have no effect on the improvement in migraine symptoms.\n",

      "METHODS: In the 12-week double-blind period of the FOCUS study, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to quarterly fremanezumab, monthly fremanezumab, or matched monthly placebo. NNT was based on responder analysis, defined as ≥50% reduction in monthly average number of migraine days at 12 weeks. NNH was based on discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs).\n",
      "RESULTS: Among patients with CM (n = 509), response rates and discontinuation rates were 27% (45/169) and 0 for quarterly fremanezumab, 29% (50/173) and 2% (3/173) for monthly fremanezumab, and 8% (13/167) and <1% (1/167) for placebo, respectively. These results translated to NNTs of 5.3 and 4.7, NNHs of 1000 and 88, and LHHs of 188 and 19 for quarterly and monthly fremanezumab, respectively. Among patients with EM (n = 328), response rates were 47% (50/107) for quarterly fremanezumab, 43% (47/110) for monthly fremanezumab, and 10% (11/111) for placebo.

      "INTRODUCTION: There have been no prior trials directly comparing the efficacy of different calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists for migraine prevention. Reported are the results from the first head-to-head study of two CGRP antagonists, galcanezumab (monoclonal antibody) versus rimegepant (gepant), for the prevention of episodic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: In this 3-month, double-blind, double-dummy study, participants were randomized (1:1) to subcutaneous (SC) galcanezumab 120 mg per month (after a 240 mg loading dose) and a placebo oral disintegrating tablet (ODT) every other day (q.o.d.) or to rimegepant 75 mg ODT q.o.d. and a monthly SC placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with a ≥ 50% reduction in migraine headache days per month from baseline across the 3-month double-blind treatment period. Key secondary endpoints were overall mean change from baseline in: migraine headache days per month across 3 months and at month 3, 2, and 1; migraine headache days per month with acute migraine medication use; Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Role Function-Restrictive domain score at month 3; and a ≥ 75% and 100% reduction from baseline in migraine headache days per month across 3 months.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 580 randomized participants (galcanezumab: 287, rimegepant: 293; mean age: 42 years), 83% were female and 81% Caucasian. Galcanezumab was not superior to rimegepant in achieving a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in migraine headache days per month (62% versus 61% respectively; P = 0.70). Given the pre-specified multiple testing procedure, key secondary endpoints cannot be considered statistically significant. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 21% of participants, with no significant differences between study intervention groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Galcanezumab was not superior to rimegepant for the primary endpoint; however, both interventions demonstrated efficacy as preventive treatments in participants with episodic migraine. The efficacy and safety profiles observed in galcanezumab-treated participants were consistent with previous studies.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Neck pain is common among individuals with migraine, but there is a lack of information of how this comorbidity can be associated with cervical muscle function. This controlled cross-sectional study aimed to compare cervical muscle function, activity, and sensitization in women with migraine, neck pain, both, and neither.\n",
      "METHODS: This study included women, between 18 and 55 years old, with either episodic migraine with or without aura, without any concomitant headache diagnosis; chronic neck pain, with at least moderate intensity and mild disability; or neither headache nor neck pain. Pain pressure threshold, allodynia, muscle strength, and endurance and cervical muscles activity were evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred subjects, with mean age of 30.4 years old, were stratified by diagnosis (n = 25 per group) and by self-reported pain during tests. Lower endurance during flexion was observed for migraine and neck pain (34s) relative to neck pain alone (45s), migraine (40s), and controls (58s) (p = 0.04). For extensor endurance, means were 142s, 166s, 215s, and 270s, respectively (p < 0.001). Endurance times were impacted by the presence of test-induced pain decreasing about 40%-53% of the performance. Diagnostic groups did not differ significantly in strength (p > 0.05), but all pain groups presented significantly higher proportion of test-induced pain, lower muscle activity during the maximal isometric voluntary contractions, and lower pressure pain thresholds.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with migraine, chronic neck pain, and the association of both present altered cervical muscle function and activity. Also, test-induced pain impacts significantly on neck muscles endurance.\n",
      "SIGNIFICANCE: The diagnosis of migraine and chronic neck pain is associated with altered function and activity of the cervical muscles. However, the test-induced pain had an important contribution to worse cervical muscle endurance. This suggests that the therapeutic approach should focus on de-sensitization of the trigeminal-cervical complex when dealing with the comorbidity of migraine and cervical pain.\n",

      "METHODS: This case-control analytical study was conducted on 37 subjects with MD and 37 healthy subjects. Subfoveal CT (SCT), large choroidal vessel (LCV) layer thickness, and mean subfoveal LCV thickness/mean SCT ratio were measured using enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) in the eyes on the MD side (ipsilateral), the contralateral eyes, and the control group.\n",
      "RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean SCT values between the ipsilateral and control groups after adjustment for age, sex, and migraine (p = 0.04). Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between the mean subfoveal LCV thickness values and the mean subfoveal LCV thickness/mean SCT ratio between the ipsilateral and control groups (p = 0.006, and p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with a duration of disease over three years had a greater mean subfoveal LCV thickness/mean SCT ratio (67.35 ± 11.56 and 60.66 ± 11.27, respectively), which was statistically insignificant (p = 0.08).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We found a thicker choroid and Haller layer, and a greater subfoveal LCV thickness/SCT ratio on the MD side compared to the controls. Furthermore, patients with a greater duration of disease had a lower subfoveal LCV thickness/SCT ratio. These findings may reflect the role of the trigeminal vascular system (TVS) and neurovascular pathophysiology in MD patients. More extensive studies are required to reach more definitive conclusions about the association between CT and MD.\n",

      "METHODS: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed chronic migraine (CM) with and without MOH based on the Third Edition of International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) were enrolled prospectively from the headache clinic of a tertiary medical center. Demographics and clinical profiles were collected by using a questionnaire, which included current use of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages, the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ), the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 1419 CM patients (1135F/284 M, mean age 41.7 ± 13.9 years) were recruited, including 799 with MOH (640F/159 M, mean age 42.5 ± 13.2 years) (56.3%). Smoking was associated with an increased risk for MOH in men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.60 [95% confidence interval = 1.73-7.50], p = 0.001), but not in women (OR = 1.34 [0.88-2.04], p = 0.171) (p = 0.021 for interaction). Hypnotic use ≥ 3 days/week was a risk factor for MOH (OR = 2.55 [95% confidence interval = 2.00-3.24], p < 0.001), regardless of sex. By using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, the cutoff scores of the LDQ for MOH were determined at 7 for women and 6 for men, and those for the SDS were 5 and 4, respectively (area under curve all ≥ 0.83). Among patients with MOH, the male sex was associated with a shorter latency between migraine onset and CM onset (12.9 ± 11.1 vs. 15.4 ± 11.5 years, p = 0.008), despite less average headache intensity (6.7 ± 1.9 vs. 7.2 ± 1.9, p = 0.005), functional impacts (HIT-6: 63.4 ± 8.3 vs. 65.1 ± 8.0, p = 0.009), and sleep disturbances (PSQI: 10.9 ± 4.4 vs. 12.2 ± 4.3, p = 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The current study identified an association between smoking and MOH in men, as well as sex-specific cutoffs of the LDQ and the SDS, for MOH. MOH was characterized by a shorter latency between migraine onset and CM onset in men and a more severe phenotype in women. Sex should be considered as an important factor in the evaluation of MOH.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) pathway are safe and effective treatments for migraine prevention. However, the high cost of these novel therapies has led to reimbursement policies requiring patients to try multiple traditional preventives before access. In Germany, a recent change in insurance policy significantly expanded coverage for the CGRP receptor mAb erenumab, enabling migraine patients who failed just one prior prophylactic medication to receive this mAb. Here, we compare the clinical response to treatment with erenumab in migraine patients treated using the old and new coverage policy.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included CGRP-mAb naïve patients with episodic or chronic migraine, who started erenumab at our headache center according to either the old or the new insurance policy and received at least 3 consecutive injections. Headache diaries and electronic documentation were used to evaluate reductions in monthly headache and migraine days (MHD and MMD) and ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% responder rates at month 3 (weeks 9-12) of treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 146 patients who received erenumab according to the old policy and 63 patients that were treated using the new policy. At weeks 9-12 of treatment, 37.7% of the old policy group had a 50% or greater reduction in MHD, compared to 63.5% of the new policy group (P < 0.001). Mean reduction in MHD was 5.02 days (SD = 5.46) and 6.67 days (SD = 5.32, P = 0.045) in the old and new policy cohort, respectively. After propensity score matching, the marginal effect of the new policy on treatment outcome was 2.29 days (standard error, SE: 0.715, P = 0.001) more reduction in MHD, and 30.1% (SE: 10.6%, P = 0.005) increase in ≥ 50% response rate for MHD.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Starting erenumab earlier in the course of migraine progression in a real-world setting may lead to a better response than starting after multiple failed prophylactic attempts. Continually gathering real-world evidence may help policymakers in deciding how readily to cover CGRP-targeted therapies in migraine prevention.\n",

We performed a systematic literature research for randomized studies with eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab and a pooled analysis was done, using RevMan 5.4 software. For dichotomous outcomes we used risk ratio, and for continuous outcomes we used the mean difference to compare and summarize the evidence between groups. The evidence across studies, for each outcome, except serious adverse events, was assessed using GRADE evidence tables. Additionally, we report the serious adverse effects in the tables of the characteristics of the studies.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common and major cause of disability, poor quality of life, and high health care use. Access to evidence-based migraine care is limited and projected to worsen. Novel mobile health app-based tools may effectively deliver migraine patient education to support self-management, facilitate remote monitoring and treatment, and improve access to care. The risk that such an intervention may increase the care team workload is a potential implementation barrier.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe a novel electronic health record-integrated mobile app-based Migraine Interactive Care Plan (MICP) and evaluate its feasibility, usability, and impact on care teams in a community neurology practice.\n",
      "METHODS: Consecutive enrollees between September 1, 2020, and February 16, 2022, were assessed in a single-arm observational study of usability, defined by 74.3% (127/171) completing ≥1 assigned task. Task response rates, rate and type of care team escalations, and patient-reported outcomes were summarized. Patients were prospectively recruited and randomly assigned to routine care with or without the MICP from September 1, 2020, to September 1, 2021. Feasibility was defined by equal to or fewer downstream face-to-face visits, telephone contacts, and electronic messages in the MICP cohort. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables for those with at least 3 months of follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were enrolled, and of these, 127 (74.3%) patients completed ≥1 MICP-assigned task. Mean escalations per patient per month was 0.9 (SD 0.37; range 0-1.7). Patient-confirmed understanding of the educational materials ranged from 26.6% (45/169) to 56.2% (95/169). Initial mean headache days per week was 4.54 (SD 2.06) days and declined to 2.86 (SD 1.87) days at week 26. The percentage of patients reporting favorable satisfaction increased from a baseline of 35% (20/57) to 83% (15/18; response rate of 42/136, 30.9% to 28/68, 41%) over the first 6 months. A total of 121 patients with MICP were compared with 62 patients in the control group. No differences were observed in the rate of telephone contacts or electronic messages. Fewer face-to-face visits were observed in the MICP cohort (13/121, 10.7%) compared with controls (26/62, 42%; P<.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We describe the successful implementation of an electronic health record-integrated mobile app-based care plan for migraine in a community neurology practice. We observed fewer downstream face-to-face visits without increasing telephone calls, medication refills, or electronic messages. Our findings suggest that the MICP has the potential to improve patient access without increasing care team workload and the need for patient input from diverse populations to improve and sustain patient engagement. Additional studies are needed to assess its impact in primary care.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disorder associated with neuropeptide release, pain and inflammation. Tau protein has recently been linked to inflammatory diseases and can be influenced by neuropeptides such as CGRP, a key neurotransmitter in migraine. Here, we report serum concentrations of total-tau protein in migraine patients and healthy controls.\n",
      "METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, interictal blood samples from n = 92 patients with episodic migraine (EM), n = 93 patients with chronic migraine (CM), and n = 42 healthy matched controls (HC) were studied. We assessed serum total-tau protein (t-tau) and for comparison neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L (UCH-L1) concentrations using the Neurology 4-plex kit, on a single molecule array HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix Corp Lexington, MA). Matched serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were used for post-hoc evaluations of a central nervous system (CNS) source of relevant findings. We applied non-parametric tests to compare groups and assess correlations.\n",
      "RESULTS: Serum t-tau concentrations were elevated in EM [0.320 (0.204 to 0.466) pg/mL] and CM [0.304 (0.158 to 0.406) pg/mL] patients compared to HC [0.200 (0.114 to 0.288) pg/mL] (p = 0.002 vs. EM; p = 0.025 vs. CM). EM with aura [0.291 (0.184 to 0.486 pg/mL); p = 0.013] and EM without aura [0.332 (0.234 to 0.449) pg/mL; p = 0.008] patients had higher t-tau levels than HC but did not differ between each other. Subgroup analysis of CM with/without preventive treatment revealed elevated t-tau levels compared to HC only in the non-prevention group [0.322 (0.181 to 0.463) pg/mL; p = 0.009]. T-tau was elevated in serum (p = 0.028) but not in cerebrospinal fluid (p = 0.760). In contrast to t-tau, all proteins associated with cell damage (NfL, GFAP, and UCH-L1), did not differ between groups.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Migraine is associated with t-tau elevation in serum but not in the CSF. Our clinical study identifies t-tau as a new target for migraine research.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) systematically collected, evaluated, and combined the evidence for migraine treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in various databases, such as PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and China Biomedical Literature. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality, risk of bias, reporting quality, and strength of evidence of the included studies using AMSTAR-2, ROBIS, the PRISMA checklist, and the GRADE system.\n",
      "RESULTS: We performed an overview of 7 relevant SRs, of which 4 were of moderate quality and 3 were of low quality according to AMSTAR 2. All SRs had low risk of bias in Phase 1 (Assessing relevance), Domain 1 (Study eligibility criteria), and Domain 4 (Synthesis and findings) as evaluated by ROBIS. In Domain 2 (Identification and selection of studies), 4 SRs (57.1%) had low risk of bias, while in Domain 3 (data collection and study appraisal) and Risk of Bias in the Review Phase 3, 4 SRs (57.1%) had low risk of bias. The PRISMA reporting standards were generally comprehensive, but some limitations were observed in the assessments, pooled results, evidence reliability, registration and protocols, and funding sources. The GRADE levels ranged from moderate to low, with 10 outcomes of moderate quality and 6 outcomes of low quality. The main reason for the low quality of evidence was the small sample size and high heterogeneity of the available studies.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: TMS may improve migraine severity and frequency, but the evidence is limited due to methodological flaws and heterogeneity. Future studies should standardize use, assess side effects, and compare with other treatments.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Intranasal agents may be ideal for the treatment of migraine patients. Many new acute intranasal-specific therapies have been developed, but few of them have been directly compared. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and safety of various intranasal agents for the treatment of acute migraine in adult patients.\n",
      "METHODS: The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and PubMed were searched from inception to 15 August 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using intranasal agents (no restrictions on dose, formulation, dosing regimen or timing of the first dose) to treat adult patients with acute migraine were included. The primary efficacy endpoint was pain freedom at 2 h, and the primary safety endpoint was adverse events (AEs). The analysis process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nineteen studies (21 RCTs, 9738 participants) were included. Compared to the placebo, 5 mg of zolmitriptan using a conventional liquid nasal spray device was the most effective for pain freedom at 2 h [odds ratio (OR): 4.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.43 to 6.43] and 24 h (OR: 5.49, 95% CI: 3.58 to 8.42) among all the interventions. Butorphanol nasal spray 1 mg was the most effective (OR: 8.62, 95% CI: 1.11 to 66.92) for pain freedom at 1 h, but with low-quality evidence. DFN-02 presented the highest freedom from nausea (OR: 4.95, 95% CI: 1.29 to 19.01) and phonophobia (OR: 5.36, 95% CI: 1.67 to 17.22) at 2 h, albeit with lower odds of achieving complete pain freedom. ROX-828 showed the highest improvement in freedom from photophobia at 2 h (OR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.66 to 9.81). Dihydroergotamine nasal spray was significantly associated with the highest risk of AEs (OR: 9.65, 95% CI: 4.39 to 21.22) and was not recommended for routine use. Zavegepant nasal spray demonstrated the lowest risk of AEs (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.37 to 3.03). The results of sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoints (pain freedom at 2 h and AEs) were generally consistent with those of the base case model.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other new intranasal-specific therapies in treating migraine attacks, zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg was the most effective agent for pain freedom at 2 h. Zavegepant nasal spray 10 mg had the fewest adverse side effects.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Four CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for migraine prophylaxis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2018. However, there are concerns about the safety of these four drugs for real-world use.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the adverse event profiles of four CGRP-mAbs with FAERS data.\n",
      "METHODS: The study was based on records from the FAERS database. Only reports containing one of the active ingredients with CGRP-mAbs were included in this study. Disproportionality analyses including but not limited to reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (IC) were conducted to identify drug-AE associations.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 58110 reports were identified for CGRP-mAbs. 80 overlapping signals were disproportionately reported. They affected a range of organs and systems, including the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems, skin, and hair. Additionally, the rare cardiovascular adverse events were significantly different among the four CGRP-mAbs.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We identified numerous shared underlying signals (overlapping signals) for CGRP-mAbs as suspected drugs in multiple systems and organs. The unlabeled common signals may indicate potential safety issues. In addition, the underlying safety signals varied among the four CGRP-mAbs, particularly in the cardiovascular system, and further studies are needed to confirm these associations and the potential clinical implications.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the prescribing patterns of preventive medications between pediatric and adult neurologists for young adults with migraine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although preventive medications are effective for adults with migraine, studies in children have failed to demonstrate similar efficacy. As a result, lifestyle modifications and non-pharmacological interventions are often emphasized in children. It is not known whether young adults are prescribed preventive medications at different rates according to whether they are cared for by an adult or pediatric neurologist.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of patients with migraine aged 18-25 years who were seen by a pediatric or adult neurologist at Mass General Brigham Hospital between 2017 and 2021. The primary outcome was whether the patient received a prescription for any preventive medication during the study period.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 767 included patients, 290 (37.8%) were seen by a pediatric neurologist. Preventive medications were prescribed for 131/290 (45.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.5%, 51.0%) patients seen by a pediatric neurologist and 206/477 (43.2%; 95% CI: 39.0%, 47.7%) patients seen by an adult neurologist (p = 0.591). In the mixed effects logistic regression model, clinician specialty was not associated with preventive medication use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.31). Female sex (AOR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.66) and number of visits during the study period (AOR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.49, 1.80) were associated with receiving preventive medication.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Approximately two fifths of young adults with migraine were prescribed preventive medications, and this proportion did not differ according to clinician specialty. Although these findings suggest that pediatric and adult neurologists provide comparable care, both specialties may be underusing preventive medications in this patient population.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Although one of the major presentations of vestibular migraine is dizziness with/without unsteady gait, it is still classified as one of the migraine categories. However, in contrast to ordinary migraine, vestibular migraine patients have distinct characteristics, and the detailed treatment strategy for vestibular migraine is different and more challenging than ordinary migraine treatment. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence regarding its management, including vestibular migraine prophylaxis.\n",
      "AIM: The objective of this current network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of individual treatment strategies in patients with vestibular migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Web of Science, ClinicalKey, Cochrane Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with a final literature search date of 30 December 2022. Patients diagnosed with vestibular migraine were included. The PICO of the current study included (1) patients with vestibular migraine; (2) intervention: any active pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic intervention; (3) comparator: placebo-control, active control, or waiting list; and (4) outcome: changes in migraine frequency or severity. This NMA of RCTs of vestibular migraine treatment was conducted using a frequentist model. We arranged inconsistency and similarity tests to re-examine the assumption of NMA, and also conducted a subgroup analysis focusing on RCTs of pharmacological treatment for vestibular migraine management. The primary outcome was changes in the frequency of vestibular migraines, while the secondary outcomes were changes in vestibular migraine severity and acceptability. Acceptability was set as the dropout rate, which was defined as the participant leaving the study before the end of the trial for any reason. Two authors independently evaluated the risk of bias for each domain using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (N = 828, mean age 37.6 years, 78.4% female) and seven active regimens were included. We determined that only valproic acid (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.69, -0.54), propranolol (SMD -1.36, 95% CI -2.55, -0.17), and venlafaxine (SMD -1.25, 95% CI -2.32, -0.18) were significantly associated with better improvement in vestibular migraine frequency than the placebo/control groups. Furthermore, among all the investigated pharmacologic/non-pharmacologic treatments, valproic acid yielded the greatest decrease in vestibular migraine frequency among all the interventions. In addition, most pharmacologic/non-pharmacologic treatments were associated with similar acceptability (i.e. dropout rate) as those of the placebo/control groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that only valproic acid, propranolol, and venlafaxine might be associated with beneficial efficacy in vestibular migraine treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: Migraine is a common disorder in children, and its prophylaxis with minimal side effects is momentous. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of Pregabalin and Sodium Valproate in preventing migraine attacks.\n",
      "MATERIAL & METHODS: Sixty-four children (aged 6-18) with migraines were recruited, as defined by Internation Headache Criteria (ICHD-III). They were randomly assigned to two groups: Sodium Valproate (n=32) and Pregabalin (n=32). The minimum dosage of drugs was prescribed in both groups. The patients were followed for four months. The parameters such as frequency, intensity, duration of migraine attacks, and the number of painkillers that the patients used monthly were recorded. The Spence Children's anxiety scale was also used to evaluate medications' effect on patients' anxiety levels.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two medications were equally effective in reducing the intensity and duration of attacks. Additionally, their effect on reducing the anxiety level of patients was equal. There was a significant difference between the effect of drugs on the frequency of migraine attacks at the end of the first and fourth months and the number of painkillers used at the end of the fourth month. The frequency of attacks was decreased by more than 50% in twenty-eight patients (90%) of Pregabalin recipients and twenty-one patients (84%) of Sodium Valproate recipients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Considering the better effect of Pregabalin in the reduction of frequency of migraine attacks and pain-reducing medications consumption, Pregabalin could be a proper substitute for Sodium Valproate for prophylactic migraine treatment in children.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether new daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a single disorder or heterogenous group of disorders, and whether it is a unique disorder from chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache. We describe a large group of patients with primary NDPH, compare its phenotype to transformed chronic daily headache (T-CDH), and use cluster analysis to reveal potential sub-phenotypes in the NDPH group.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a case-control study using prospectively collected clinical data in patients with primary NDPH and T-CDH (encompassing chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache). We used logistic regression with propensity score matching to compare demographics, phenotype, comorbidities, and treatment responses between NDPH and T-CDH. We used K-means cluster analysis with Gower distance to identify sub-clusters in the NDPH group based on a combination of demographics, phenotype, and comorbidities.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 366 patients with NDPH and 696 with T-CDH who met inclusion criteria. Patients with NDPH were less likely to be female (62.6% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001). Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, motion sensitivity, vertigo, and cranial autonomic symptoms were all significantly less frequent in NDPH than T-CDH (p value for all < 0.001). Acute treatments appeared less effective in NDPH than T-CDH, and medication overuse was less common (16% vs. 42%, p < 0.001). Response to most classes of oral preventive treatments was poor in both groups. The most effective treatment in NDPH was doselupin in 45.7% patients (95% CI 34.8-56.5%). Cluster analysis identified three subgroups of NDPH. Cluster 1 was older, had a high proportion of male patients, and less severe headaches. Cluster 2 was predominantly female, had severe headaches, and few associated symptoms. Cluster 3 was predominantly female with a high prevalence of migrainous symptoms and headache triggers.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Whilst there is overlap in the phenotype of NDPH and T-CDH, the differences in migrainous, cranial autonomic symptoms, and vulnerability to medication overuse suggest that they are not the same disorder. NDPH may be fractionated into three sub-phenotypes, which require further investigation.\n",

      "METHODS: A total of 54 patients with migraine without aura were randomized into an observation group (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (27 cases, 2 cases dropped off). The basic western medication treatment was adopted in the two groups. In the control group, mild moxibustion was applied at Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20) and Yanglingquan (GB 34) on the affected side. In the observation group, the frequent acupoint areas of the affected side i.e. Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Taichong (LR 3), Yanglingquan (GB 34) were determined, 3 acupoints with strong heat-sensitive sensation were selected each time and mild moxibustion was adopted. The treatment was given once a day, 5 times of treatment was as one course and 2 courses were required in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the scores of migraine symptom, visual analogue scale (VAS), migraine specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ) were observed, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated after treatment in the two groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of migraine symptom and VAS were decreased compared with those before treatment (P&lt;0.01), while the MSQ scores were increased compared with those before treatment (P&lt;0.01) in the two groups. After treatment, the scores of migraine symptom and VAS in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05), while the MSQ score in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The total effective rate was 92.0% (23/25) in the observation group, which was superior to 72.0% (18/25) in the control group (P&lt;0.05).\n",

      "METHOD: The data on migraine patients who underwent PNB in our clinic between November 2019 and January 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Blocks of the greater occipital nerve (GON), lesser occipital nerve (LON) and supraorbital nerve (SON) were performed upon admission and in the second week.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 116 patients. While 21 out of 39 episodic migraine (EM) patients continued to use prophylactic medications, 18 were followed up with PNB alone. While 49 out of 77 chronic migraine (CM) patients continued to use prophylactic medications, 28 were followed up with PNB alone. Comparison of the admission and second-month data of the patients who only underwent PNB and those who continued the drug treatment together with PNB in both the EM and the CM group showed that the number of days with pain, number of analgesics taken and scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) were significantly reduced in both groups (p &lt; 0.01). Comparison of the second-month data of the patients followed up with PNB alone and those followed up with PNB together with prophylactic medications showed that there was no significant difference between the EM and CM patients (p &gt; 0.05).\n",

A \"most recent treatment episode\" analysis was used in which the most recent episode was defined as the latest treatment period with the same drug (anti-CGRP mAb or onabotulinumtoxinA) without a ≥ 15-day gap in medication supply on/after June 25, 2020, to December 31, 2021. Patients were indexed at the start of their most recent episode. Patients were considered non-persistent and discontinued the therapy associated with their most recent episode if there was ≥ 15-day gap in medication supply. A Cox proportional-hazards model estimated the discontinuation hazard between treatments. The gap periods and cohort definition were varied in sensitivity analyses.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 66,576 patients (median age 46 years, 88.6% female). More eptinezumab-treated patients had chronic migraine (727/1074), ≥ 3 previous acute (323/1074) or preventive (333/1074) therapies, and more prior treatment episodes (3) than other treatment groups. Based on a 15-day treatment gap, patients on subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs had a 32% (95% CI: 1.19, 1.49; erenumab), 42% (95% CI: 1.27, 1.61; galcanezumab), and 58% (95% CI: 1.42, 1.80; fremanezumab) higher discontinuation hazard than those receiving eptinezumab, with this relationship attenuated, but still statistically significant based on 30-day and 60-day treatment gaps. There was no significant difference in the discontinuation hazard between eptinezumab and onabotulinumtoxinA. Based on a 15-day treatment gap among patients who newly initiated therapy, the discontinuation hazard of subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs remained significantly higher compared to eptinezumab and onabotulinumtoxinA.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients treated with eptinezumab demonstrated persistency that was higher than subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs and similar to onabotulinumtoxinA.\n",

      "METHODS: Patients with PFO complicated with cryptogenic stroke or migraine who underwent transcatheter closure of PFO in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from September 2019 to March 2021 were selected. Patients were grouped according to the type of occluder device. The basic data of the patients were collected and followed up within 1 year after occlusion. Effectiveness was defined as no recurrence of stroke/remission of migraine symptoms and a negative postoperative foaming test, and safety events were counted as the combined results of serious adverse events.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were selected, including 45 cases in the symmetrical group and 47 cases in the asymmetric group. There were no serious adverse events in the 2 groups during follow-up. 3 days and 1 month after occlusion, the number of shunt patients in the asymmetric group was significantly less than that in the symmetric group (χ2 = 5.484, P = 0.019; χ2 = 5.146, P = 0.023). The negative rate of blocked residual shunts in the asymmetric group was higher than that in the symmetric group at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after occlusion (χ2 = 6.473, P = 0.011; χ2 = 4.305, P = 0.038; χ2 = 4.842, P = 0.027; χ2 = 4.034, P = 0.045).

      "METHODS: We systematically searched databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane, and included all eligible randomized controlled trials in the study. We conducted the statistical analysis using Stata version 14.0, based on the frequentist framework. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB2) to assess the risk of bias of the included studies.\n",
      "RESULTS: This network meta-analysis included 14 randomized controlled trials with 4601 patients. For short-term prophylaxis, frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily had the highest probability of effectiveness [OR = 1.87 (95% CI: 1.48 to 2.38)] compared to placebo.

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical features, risk factors, distribution of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) subtypes, and effectiveness of canalith repositioning between geriatric and non-geriatric patients with BPPV.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 400 patients with BPPV were enrolled. Canalith repositioning was performed according to the semicircular canals involved. Patients were divided by age into a geriatric group (≥60 years) and a non-geriatric group (20-59 years). Clinical characteristics, potential age-related risk factors, distribution of subtypes, and effectiveness of canalith repositioning were compared between the groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Female sex was significantly more common in all age groups, with a peak female-to-male ratio of 5.1:1 in the group aged 50-59 years. There was a higher proportion of men in the geriatric group. A history of disease associated with atherosclerosis was significantly more common in the geriatric group (p < 0.05). Migraine was significantly more common in the non-geriatric group (p = 0.018), as was posterior canal BPPV. The horizontal canal BPPV (especially horizontal canal BPPV-cupulolithiasis), and multicanal BPPV subtypes were more common in the geriatric group, whereas anterior canal BPPV was more common in the non-geriatric group. Two canalith repositioning sessions were effective in 58.0% of the geriatric cases and in 72.6% of the non-geriatric cases (p = 0.002). There was a tendency for the effectiveness of canalith repositioning to decrease with increasing age.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: BPPV was more common in women. However, the proportion of men with BPPV increased with age. Elderly patients often had a history of diseases associated with atherosclerosis (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia). The horizontal canal BPPV (particularly horizontal canal BPPV-cupulolithiasis) and multicanal BPPV subtypes were more common and the anterior canal BPPV subtype was less common in elderly patients. The effectiveness of canalith repositioning may decrease with age. Therefore, older patients should receive more comprehensive medical treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The differentiation between Vestibular Migraine (VM) and Meniere's Disease (MD) is difficult because of overlapping symptoms. The study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and vestibular function test results between VM and MD patients.\n",
      "METHODS: Seventy-one patients with definite VM and 31 patients with definite unilateral MD were included. All patients received Caloric Test (CT), Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) test within 7 days after visiting the hospital. Results of these tests were compared between groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Most VM patients (64.0%) experienced spontaneous internal vertigo, while most MD patients (66.7%) experienced spontaneous external vertigo. MD patients had more severe vestibular symptoms and autonomic responses compared to VM patients during attacks (p =  0.03, p = 0.00, respectively). The nystagmus intensity of CT-induced was greater in VM patients than in MD patients (p = 0.003). More VM patients had CT intolerance and Central Positional Nystagmus (CPN) compared to MD patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.006, respectively). More MD patients had CT(+) and vHIT saccades wave compared to VM patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). The non-elicitation rate of cervical VEMP was higher, and the ocular VEMP amplitudes were lower in MD patients than in VM patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.018).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular symptoms during attacks combined with the results of vestibular function tests may be used to differentiate between VM and MD. The diverse nature of vestibular symptoms (especially internal vertigo), history of motion sickness and CT intolerance may provide clues to the diagnosis of VM, whereas spontaneous external vertigo, CT(+) with vHIT(-), and the presence of saccades may provide clues to the diagnosis of MD.\n",

      "DESIGN: A systematic literature review.\n",
      "DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus through March 2022.\n",
      "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original, empirical, peer-reviewed findings (cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and case series) published in English and focused on SRC. Studies needed to compare individuals with PPCS to a comparison group or their own baseline prior to concussion, on tests or measures potentially affected by concussion or associated with PPCS.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 3298 records screened, 26 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, including 1016 participants with concussion and 531 in comparison groups; 7 studies involved adults, 8 involved children and adolescents and 11 spanned both age groups. No studies focused on diagnostic accuracy. Studies were heterogeneous in participant characteristics, definitions of concussion and PPCS, timing of assessment and the tests and measures examined. Some studies found differences between individuals with PPCS and comparison groups or their own pre-injury assessments, but definitive conclusions were not possible because most studies had small convenience samples, cross-sectional designs and were rated high risk of bias.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of PPCS continues to rely on symptom report, preferably using standardised symptom rating scales. The existing research does not indicate that any other specific tool or measure has satisfactory accuracy for clinical diagnosis. Future research drawing on prospective, longitudinal cohort studies could help inform clinical practice.\n",

      "METHODS: We searched online databases like PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science till June 2022 for RCTs that compared metoclopramide alone with placebo or active drugs. The main outcomes were the mean change in headache score and complete headache relief. The secondary outcomes were the rescue medications need, side effects, nausea and recurrence rate. We qualitatively reviewed the outcomes. Then, we performed the network meta-analyses (NMAs) when it was possible. which were done by the Frequentist method using the MetaInsight online software.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included with a total of 1934 patients: 826 received metoclopramide, 302 received placebo, and 806 received other active drugs. Metoclopramide was effective in reducing headache outcomes even for 24 h. The intravenous route was the most chosen route in the included studies and showed significant positive results regarding headache outcomes; however, the best route whether intramuscular, intravenous, or suppository was not compared in the previous studies. Also, both 10 and 20 mg doses of metoclopramide were effective in improving headache outcomes; however, there was no direct comparison between both doses and the 10 mg dose was the most frequently used dosage. In NMA of headache change after 30 min or 1 h, metoclopramide effect came after granisetron, ketorolac, chlorpromazine, and Dexketoprofen trometamol. Only granisetron's effect was significantly higher than metoclopramide's effect which was only significantly higher than placebo and sumatriptan. In headache-free symptoms, only prochlorperazine was non-significantly higher than metoclopramide which was higher than other medications and showed significantly higher effects only with placebo. In rescue medication, metoclopramide's effect was only non-significantly lower than prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine while its effect was higher than other drugs and showed higher significant effects only than placebo and valproate. In the recurrence rate, studies showed no significant difference between metoclopramide and other drugs. Metoclopramide significantly decreased nausea more than the placebo. Regarding side effects, metoclopramide showed a lower incidence of mild side effects than pethidine and chlorpromazine and showed a higher incidence of mild side effects than placebo, dexamethasone, and ketorolac. The reported extrapyramidal symptoms with metoclopramide were dystonia or akathisia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: A dose of 10 mg IV Metoclopramide was effective in relieving migraine attacks with minimal side effects. Compared to other active drugs, it only showed a lower significant effect compared with granisetron regarding headache change while it showed significantly higher effects only with placebo in both rescue medication needs and headache-free symptoms and valproate in only rescue medication need. Also, it significantly decreased headache scores more than placebo and sumatriptan. However, more studies are needed to support our results.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been tested extensively in several clinical trials for both episodic and chronic migraine, showing high effectiveness, safety, and tolerability; however, there are no prospective real-world studies intending to compare their efficacy and safety.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a prospective observational cohort study comparing the effectiveness and safety profiles of galcanezumab, fremanezumab, and erenumab for the treatment of chronic and episodic migraine. We enrolled 140 patients at the Headache Centre of University Federico II of Naples, with a history of multiple failed treatments with validated migraine preventatives. Framenezumab, erenumab, or galcanezumab were administered for 12 months. The mean monthly days with headache, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, and adverse events were evaluated during the run-in period and every 3 months by reviewing standardized paper patient headache diaries.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found a mean reduction of migraine monthly days from baseline of -12.0 (-9.8, -14.1) in the galcanezumab group, -12.3 (-10.2, -14.3) in the fremanezumab group, and -10.8 (-8.5, -13.1) in the erenumab group (for all, p < 0.001). We found a mean reduction of MIDAS score of -32.6 (-26.6, -38.5) in the galcanezumab group, -33.4 (-28.0, -38.9) in the fremanezumab group, and -29.2 (-23.0, -35.4) in the erenumab group (for all, p < 0.001). We found no significant differences between mAbs in the reduction of mean monthly days with headache and MIDAS score. We found a more rapid effect of galcanezumab and erenumab compared to fremanezumab in medication overuse headache patients after 3 months of treatment (-10.8 and -11.1 vs. -4.0 days; p = 0.029).\n",

      "METHODS: A total of 86 migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and 73 healthy controls were included. The Voxel-Based Morphometry approach was utilized to compare the gray matter volume (GMV) differences between MwoA patients and healthy controls. The Structural Covariance Network analysis was conducted to quantify the cross-regional synchronous alterations of gray matter structure in MwoA patients. The Causal Structural Covariance Network analysis was performed to describe the progressive and hierarchical changes in the gray matter network of patients in the pathological progression of migraine.\n",
      "RESULTS: MwoA patients had duration-stage related GMV hypertrophy in the left parahippocampus, as well as synergistic GMV aberrance in the parahippocampus and the medial inferior temporal gyrus and cerebellum. Moreover, the GMV alteration of the parahippocampus, and the surrounding hippocampus, amygdala, and bilateral anterior cerebellum, preceded and causally influenced the morphological changes of lateral parietal-temporal-occipital gyrus, as well as the motor cortex and prefrontal gyrus with the increasing illness duration in MwoA patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The current study indicated that gray matter structural alterations in the medial inferior temporal gyrus, especially the parahippocampus, is a critical pathological characteristic in MwoA patients, which drives the gray matter structure alteration of other regions. These findings provide further evidence for understanding the progressive gray matter morphological changes in migraine and may facilitate the development of neuromodulation therapies targeting this procession.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Although ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) abnormalities have been associated with vestibular migraine (VM) in adults, no studies have evaluated this in pediatric patients with VM. oVEMP asymmetry with normal cervical VEMP (cVEMP) findings may be a reliable VM biomarker in adults. We characterize VEMP results among pediatric patients with VM and benign recurrent vertigo of childhood (BRVC), a migraine precursor, and compare these results with VEMP findings from pediatric patients with nonmigrainous vestibular diagnoses.\n",
      "METHODS: Four hundred seventy-four pediatric patients were evaluated over a 3-year period in a multidisciplinary pediatric vestibular clinic, 139 of whom met the inclusion criteria. Records were reviewed for history, audiometry, and vestibular testing results. VEMP testing was performed with a 500-Hz tone burst. Based on adult normative data, oVEMP asymmetry was defined as greater than 33% interaural difference; cVEMP asymmetry was defined as greater than 41%.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eighty subjects had VM or BRVC (mean [standard deviation] 12.8 [3.8] yr; range, 4.3-18.2 yr). Fifty-nine subjects received vestibular diagnoses other than VM or BRVC (nonmigrainous group; mean [standard deviation] age, 13.0 [3.6] yr; range, 5.14-18.9 yr). A greater proportion of the VM/BRVC group demonstrated oVEMP asymmetry with normal cVEMP as compared with the nonmigrainous group (22.5% versus 10.1%; p < 0.05). Zero subjects in the VM/BRVC group demonstrated cVEMP asymmetry versus three subjects (4.9%) of the nonmigrainous group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: VM and BRVC are notable causes of migraine-related vertigo among pediatric patients. Of VM/BRVC patients, 22.5% had oVEMP asymmetry with normal cVEMP. Similar to the adult VM population, this finding may be a useful biomarker in the right clinical setting for pediatric VM.\n",

      "PURPOSE: Disturbances of sleep have frequently been reported in individuals with migraine. On top of this, an elderly patient with migraine also suffers from sleep disturbances due to changes in physiologic and mental health associated with aging. This study aimed to compare several sleep factors, namely sleep quality, chronotype, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk, between elderly people with and without migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in 10 neurologic clinics located in Tehran, Iran, over 2 years. The sample size was calculated as 189, including 63 migraine and 126 non-migraine patients.\n",
      "RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in the mean score of the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) between migraine and non-migraine groups (p-value = 0.002), and in the individual components of the PSQI. However, there were no significant differences in the frequency of different types of chronotype (p-value = 0.125, T = 1.541) or OSA risk between the two groups (p-value = 0.568, T = -0.573). The binary logistic regression model showed that the relationship between global PSQI and migraine was significant (p = 0.002).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a painful, prevalent, and problematic condition among children. Children need access to safe and effective treatment options to alleviate the impact of this chronic condition on their wellbeing.\n",
      "CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses have a crucial role in supporting patient access to BTX-A. Given the results of this and other studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of BTX-A in children, nurses can support policy change for health plans to fund this intervention for pediatric migraineurs. Allowing children to receive the safe and effective BTX-A injections will lessen the already significant impact of chronic migraine on their physical, emotional and mental health. Nurses can also play a key role in providing education to patients regarding safe administration of BTX-A for migraine.\n",
      "AIM: The objective of this study was to define the experiences, effects, and clinical response of children to onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) for migraine prevention.\n",
      "METHODS: Clinical documentation for patients aged 13-17 years presenting for BTX-A treatment for chronic migraine between 2016-2022 in a community-based specialty clinic within a large, urban, pediatric academic medical center were included. A series of one-way repeated measures (analysis of variance [ANOVA]) were conducted to compare headache frequency, severity, and duration at baseline, and following first and second injections of BTX-A.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 32 eligible participants, administration of BTX-A demonstrated a decrease in headache frequency and severity. Participants reported nearly seven fewer headache days per month. Participants reported neck stiffness, fever or flu-like symptoms, fatigue, and worsening pain following BTX-A administration.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric migraineurs need therapies that are safe, effective, and accessible. BTX-A was a safe and effective treatment for migraine among the children included in this study.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Return-to-learn (RTL) after sport-related concussion (SRC) is an important yet understudied topic. The authors sought to do the following: 1) describe patterns of RTL among athletes by school level (i.e., middle school, high school, college); and 2) evaluate the predictive value of school level on RTL duration.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective, single-institution cohort study of adolescent and young adult athletes 12-23 years old who sustained an SRC between November 2017 and April 2022 and who presented to a multidisciplinary specialty concussion clinic was conducted. The independent variable was school level, trichotomized into middle school, high school, and college. Time to RTL was the primary outcome and was defined as days from SRC to return to any academic activities. ANOVA was used to compare RTL duration across school levels. A multivariable linear regression was performed to evaluate for predictive value of school level on RTL duration. Covariates included the following: sex, race/ethnicity, learning disorder, psychiatric conditions, migraines, family history of psychiatric conditions/migraines, initial Post-Concussion Symptom Scale score, and number of prior concussions.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 1007 total athletes, 116 (11.5%) were in middle school, 835 (83.0%) were in high school, and 56 (5.6%) were in college. The mean RTL times (in days) were as follows: 8.0 ± 13.1 (middle school), 8.5 ± 13.7 (high school), and 15.6 ± 22.3 (college). One-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between groups (F[2, 1007] = 6.93, p = 0.001). A Tukey post hoc test revealed a longer RTL duration in collegiate athletes when compared to middle school (p = 0.003) and high school (p < 0.001) athletes. Collegiate athletes had longer RTL duration compared to other school levels (β = 0.14, p < 0.001). There was no difference between middle school and high school athletes (p = 0.935). The subanalysis revealed a longer RTL duration in high school freshmen/sophomores (9.5 ± 14.9 days) when compared to juniors/seniors (7.6 ± 12.6 days; t = 2.05, p = 0.041), and being an older (junior/senior) high school athlete was predictive of shorter RTL duration (β = -0.11, p = 0.011).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: When examining patients who presented to a multidisciplinary sport concussion center, RTL duration was longer in collegiate athletes when compared to middle and high school athletes. Younger high school athletes had longer time to RTL compared to their older counterparts. This study provides insight into how varying scholastic environments may contribute to RTL.\n",

      "METHODS: Local threshold method based on signal intensities was used to quantitatively measure volumes, and the degree of EH was scored by 3D quantitative scoring. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the diagnostic efficacy of this method against conventional evaluation methods. The scores of MD, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH), and vestibular migraine (VM) group were compared and correlated with clinical examination results, including pure tone audiometry (PTA), electrocochleogram, and caloric test.\n",
      "RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of 3D quantitative scoring were 94.1% and 92.2%, while conventional evaluation methods were 84.3% and 88.2%, respectively. Cochlear score (CR), vestibular score (VR), semicircular canal score (SR), and total scores (TR) in MD group were significantly higher than those in SSNHL group. The rate of diagnosis of MD was significantly higher in the MD group (92.2%) than VM group (27.3%). In MD, PTA was significantly correlated with CR and SR, the ratio of summating potential to action potential (-SP/AP) of electrocochleogram was significantly correlated with CR, VR, and SR, also canal paresis (CP) value of caloric test was significantly correlated with SR.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: 3D quantitative scoring demonstrated better diagnostic efficacy than conventional evaluation methods for Ménière's disease, and it may be an effective clinical tool to distinguish MD from SSNHL and VM. The clinical practicality of inner ear-enhanced MRI was further confirmed.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most common causes of emergency department (ED) visits. High-flow oxygen therapy is becoming more attractive as a treatment option because it is safe, effective, and cheap. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of high and medium-flow oxygen therapies with placebo for treating primary headache disorders among middle-aged patients.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover designed, randomized study was conducted at a regional tertiary hospital's ED. Patients who were treated for primary headache disorder in the ED were evaluated at the time of diagnosis and subsequently included in the study upon their next ED visit. Four different treatment methods were administered; 1) high-flow oxygen (15 L/min oxygen), 2) medium-flow oxygen (8 L/min oxygen), 3) high-flow room air as placebo (15 L/min room air), 4) medium-flow room air as placebo (8 L/min room air). All four treatment methods were administered to all patients included in the study, at four separate ED visits. Patients' data, including demographics, medical history, additional complaints, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, and physical examination findings were recorded by the treating physician.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and four patients with a mean age of 35.14 ± 9.1 years, were included in the study. Patients who received oxygen therapy had a significantly lower VAS score at all control points (15, 30, and 60 min) when compared with placebo (p < 0.001). This difference in scores reached its maximum at 30 min. There was not a significant statistical difference between the high-flow or mid-flow therapies (p > 0.05). It was determined that patients who received placebo therapy were more likely to revisit ED (p < 0.05). There was not a significant statistical difference between the high-flow or mid-flow therapy groups in terms of revisit (p > 0.05) and the 30th-minute analgesia requirement (p > 0.05). Pain duration was significantly less in patients who received oxygen therapy (p < 0.05). Patients who received high-flow oxygen therapy spent less time in the ED (p < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Oxygen therapy could be a beneficial treatment option for middle-aged patients with primary headache disorders. Based on the results obtained from high and mid-flow oxygen therapies, it may be more appropriate to begin treatment with mid-flow oxygen.\n",

      "IMPORTANCE: Epilepsy has been associated with cognitive impairment and potentially dementia in older individuals. However, the extent to which epilepsy may increase dementia risk, how this compares with other neurological conditions, and how modifiable cardiovascular risk factors may affect this risk remain unclear.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the differential risks of subsequent dementia for focal epilepsy compared with stroke and migraine as well as healthy controls, stratified by cardiovascular risk.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study is based on data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of more than 500 000 participants aged 38 to 72 years who underwent physiological measurements and cognitive testing and provided biological samples at 1 of 22 centers across the United Kingdom. Participants were eligible for this study if they were without dementia at baseline and had clinical data pertaining to a history of focal epilepsy, stroke, or migraine. The baseline assessment was performed from 2006 to 2010, and participants were followed up until 2021.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: Mutually exclusive groups of participants with epilepsy, stroke, and migraine at baseline assessment and controls (who had none of these conditions). Individuals were divided into low, moderate, or high cardiovascular risk groups based on factors that included waist to hip ratio, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking pack-years.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia; measures of executive function; and brain total hippocampal, gray matter, and white matter hyperintensity volumes.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 495 149 participants (225 481 [45.5%] men; mean [SD] age, 57.5 [8.1] years), 3864 had a diagnosis of focal epilepsy only, 6397 had a history of stroke only, and 14 518 had migraine only. Executive function was comparable between participants with epilepsy and stroke and worse than the control and migraine group. Focal epilepsy was associated with a higher risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 4.02; 95% CI, 3.45 to 4.68; P < .001), compared with stroke (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.28 to 2.87; P < .001), or migraine (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.21; P = .94). Participants with focal epilepsy and high cardiovascular risk were more than 13 times more likely to develop dementia (HR, 13.66; 95% CI, 10.61 to 17.60; P < .001) compared with controls with low cardiovascular risk. The imaging subsample included 42 353 participants. Focal epilepsy was associated with lower hippocampal volume (mean difference, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.02 to -0.32; t = -2.18; P = .03) and lower total gray matter volume (mean difference, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.48; t = -4.29; P < .001) compared with controls. There was no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume (mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.26; t = 1.14; P = .26).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, focal epilepsy was associated with a significant risk of developing dementia, to a greater extent than stroke, which was magnified substantially in individuals with high cardiovascular risk. Further findings suggest that targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors may be an effective intervention to reduce dementia risk in individuals with epilepsy.\n",

Migraine was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3β criteria. Age, gender, migraine-related disease duration, number of days with a headache each month, and headache intensity of the patients were recorded. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) was used to determine personality traits.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study groups were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics (70 CM, 70 EM, and 70 HC). The visual analog scale (VAS) score was significantly higher in CM (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between the groups concerning symptoms of migraine such as osmophobia, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea (p > 0.05). When the personality traits were examined, the mean scores of the MMPI test results of migraine patients were found to be higher than healthy controls in line personality disorders (p < 0.05 for all personality traits). In CM patients, the 'hysteria' score was found to be higher in subgroup evaluation (p < 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: EM and CM patients had more evidence of personality disorders than healthy controls. CM patients had higher hysteria scores than EM patients.

In this study, we aimed to compare clinical characteristics between super-responders (SR) and non-responders (NR) to CGRP(-receptor) mAbs.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Headache Center, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The definition of super-response was a ≥ 75% reduction in monthly headache days (MHD) in the third month after treatment initiation compared to the month prior to treatment begin (baseline). Non-response was defined as ≤ 25% reduction in MHD after three months of treatment with a CGRP-receptor mAb and subsequent three months of treatment with CGRP mAb, or vice versa. We collected demographic data, migraine disease characteristics, migraine symptoms during the attacks in both study groups (SR/NR) as well as the general medical history. SR and NR were compared using Chi-square test for categorical variables, and t-test for continuous variables.\n",
      "RESULTS: Between November 2018 and June 2022, n = 260 patients with migraine received preventive treatment with CGRP(-receptor) mAbs and provided complete headache documentation for the baseline phase and the third treatment month. Among those, we identified n = 29 SR (11%) and n = 26 NR (10%). SR reported more often especially vomiting (SR n = 12/25, 48% vs. NR n = 4/22, 18%; p = 0.031) and typical migraine characteristics such as unilateral localization, pulsating character, photophobia and nausea. A subjective good response to triptans was significantly higher in SR (n = 26/29, 90%) than in NR (n = 15/25, 60%, p = 0.010). NR suffered more frequently from chronic migraine (NR n = 24/26, 92% vs. SR n = 15/29, 52%; p = 0.001), medication overuse headache (NR n = 14/24, 58% versus SR n = 8/29, 28%; p = 0.024), and concomitant depression (NR n = 17/26, 65% vs. SR n = 8/29, 28%; p = 0.005).\n",

      "METHOD: This observational, prospective study included 102 patients with migraine and 36 healthy controls. Central macular thickness (CMT), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and choroidal thickness (CT) were measured using a Spectralis OCT device. The choroid vascularity index (CVI) was evaluated using the Image-J software. CVI was calculated as the proportion of the luminal area (LA) to the total choroidal area (TCA). RNFL, CMT, CT, and CVI measurements were compared statistically.\n",
      "RESULTS: Choroidal thickness at 1500 µm temporal of the fovea was found to be statistically significantly thinner in the MwA and MoA groups compared with the control group (p ≤ 0.01). There was a significant difference in the subfoveal CT values of the MwA and control groups (p < 0.05). The mean RNFL thickness of patients with migraine with visual aura was found to be statistically significantly thinner than in the migraine group with non-visual aura (98.73 ± 8.4 and 109.4 ± 16.8) (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the RNFL CMT, GCC, and CVI values in the MwA, MoA, and control groups (p > 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We found that the choroidal thickness was significantly decreased in patients with migraine, especially in the MwA group. In the visual aura subgroup, the mean RNFL thickness was significantly decreased compared with the non-visual aura subgroup.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Direct comparisons of the tolerability and safety of migraine preventive treatments targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway are lacking. This study aimed to compare the safety and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and gepants in migraine prevention.\n",
      "METHODS: A network meta-analysis of phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing the safety and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, eptinezumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) and gepants (atogepant, rimegepant) in migraine prevention was performed. Primary outcomes were treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included any adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation and individual adverse events.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 19 randomized controlled trials, comprising 14,584 patients. Atogepant 120 mg (OR 2.22, 95% CI [1.26, 3.91]) and galcanezumab 240 mg (OR 1.63, 95% CI [1.33, 2.00]) showed the largest odds of treatment-emergent adverse events compared to placebo. While eptinezumab 30 mg had greater odds of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (OR 2.62, 95% CI [1.03,6.66]). No significant differences in serious adverse events were found between active treatments and placebo. Eptinezumab was associated with the lowest odds of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events compared to placebo, whereas erenumab was associated with the lowest odds of any adverse events and quarterly fremanezumab with the lowest odds of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway and gepants are a safe and well tolerated option for migraine prevention.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Psychotherapy is one of the most highly recommended and practiced approaches for the treatment of Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Commonly defined as excessive worry that is uncontrollable, GAD is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Anxiety is also one of the most common associated symptoms of migraine. Exposing migraineurs to narrow band green light (nbGL) reduces their anxiety and anxiety-like physiological symptoms such as throat tightness, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Here, we sought to determine whether the reduced anxiety described by our patients was secondary to the reduced headache or independent of it. The goal of the current study was therefore to determine whether exposure to nbGL can reduce anxiety in GAD patients who are not migraineurs.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: Included in this open-label, proof-of-concept, prospective study were 13 patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe GAD. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Questionnaire (Y-1) to compare anxiety level before and after each 45-minutes psychotherapy session conducted in white light (WL) (intensity = 100±5 candela/m2) vs nbGL (wavelength = 520±10nm (peak ± range), intensity = 10±5 candela/m2).\n",
      "RESULTS: Here, we show that psychotherapy sessions conducted under nbGL increase positive and decrease negative feelings significantly more than psychotherapy sessions conducted under regular room light (χ2 = 0.0001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The findings provide initial evidence for the potential benefit of conducting psychotherapy sessions for patients suffering GAD under nbGL conditions. Given the absence of side effects or risks, we suggest that illuminating rooms used in psychotherapy with nbGL be considered an add-on to the treatment of GAD.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Acupuncture and fremanezumab are second-line treatments for migraine prophylaxis. We aimed to compare acupuncture with fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of episodic migraine by using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison analysis (MAIC).\n",
      "METHODS: We acquired participant-level data from an acupuncture trial recruiting 302 participants and summary-level data from a fremanezumab trial recruiting 875 participants (290 participants received monthly fremanezumab [MF] and 291 received single-dose fremanezumab [SF]). The primary outcome was the mean reduction in monthly headache days. The secondary outcomes were the mean reduction in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days, days with acute medication, and the adverse events rate.\n",
      "RESULTS: Before matching, the acupuncture arm had significantly lower BMI, fewer headache days with at least moderate severity, and fewer days with acute medication. After matching, the baseline variables were comparable between groups. The three arms had no difference in the change of monthly migraine days (MF vs. acupuncture: mean difference 0.3, 95%CI -0.5 to 1.1, p-value = 0.473; SF vs. acupuncture: mean difference 0.5, 95%CI -0.3 to 1.3, p-value = 0.214). The results were similar in the analyses of secondary outcomes sensitivity analyses. Thirty-six (25%) participants in the acupuncture arm reported adverse events, versus 192(66%) participants in the MF arm and 193 (66%) in the SF arm.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The preventive treatment effect of acupuncture is equivalent to fremanezumab, and it presented with a lower adverse event rate, which indicates that acupuncture can be an alternative to fremanezumab.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a chronic headache manifested with attacks. Here we aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 15-point Dysport injection with 31-point Xeomin injections.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a randomized clinical trial performed in 2020-2021 in Isfahan on patients with refractory chronic migraine. A total number of 60 patients entered the study. The pain of patients was also determined using headache impact test (HIT) questionnaire. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group 1 underwent 31-point Xeomin injection and Group 2 underwent 1 vial of Dysport injection into 15 points of the scalp.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our study revealed that the data regarding aura, nausea, vomit, photosensitivity, sensitivity to sounds and smells did not change significantly between two groups compared to the beginning of the study. Frequency, duration, intensity of headaches, and the mean HIT score of all patients improved significantly within 3 months after interventions. Comparing both groups showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). HIT score was decreased from 21.26 ± 3.58 before intervention to 15.51 ± 4.58 after 3 months in Group 1 and 22.23 ± 2.59-10.33 ± 2.26 in Group 2. In both groups, these changes were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Although we found more decrease of HIT score in Group 2 comparing with Group 1 (10.33 ± 2.26 vs. 15.51 ± 4.58), this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Although Xeomin and Dysport injections are both effective and reduced pain in patients with chronic migraine, our new technique is probably better than the standard technique. Because the injection points are halved, increase patients comfort and reduce overall cost.\n",

      "METHODS: We pursued a single center age- and sex-matched observational study comparing the clinical characteristics of 150 youth (11 - 17 years old) with continuous headache from migraine, persistent post-traumatic headache, and new daily persistent headache. A diagnostic algorithm based on international classification of headache disorders criteria was used to identify those with migraine (headache features of migraine with gradual onset), and persistent post-traumatic headache and new daily persistent headache (based on the circumstances of headache onset regardless of headache features). Fifty participants each with migraine, persistent post-traumatic headache, and new daily persistent headache were matched by age and sex. Participant survey responses on headache characteristics were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: Median usual headache severity was 6.0 [95%CI 6.0, 6.0] and was not different across diagnostic groups (H statistic = 1.2, p = 0.55).

      "MATERIALS & METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial study, all 30 children aged 5 to 15 years with migraine headaches and sleep disorders were referred to the Pediatric Neurology Clinic and enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups; the intervention group was treated with melatonin (3 mg daily) and propranolol (1 mg/kg daily), and the control group was treated with propranolol alone (1 mg/kg daily).

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the utilization and costs (total and out-of-pocket) of new-to-market neurologic medications with existing guideline-supported neurologic medications over time.\n",
      "METHODS: We used a healthcare pharmaceutical claims database (from 2001 to 2019) to identify patients with both a diagnosis of 1 of 11 separate neurologic conditions and either a new-to-market medication or an existing guideline-supported medication for that condition. Neurologic conditions included orthostatic hypotension, spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, transthyretin amyloidosis, and migraine. New-to-market medications were defined as all neurologic medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2014 and 2018. In each year, we determined the median out-of-pocket and standardized total costs for a 30-day supply of each medication. We also measured the proportion of patients receiving new-to-market medications compared with all medications specific for the relevant condition.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found that the utilization of most new-to-market medications was small (<20% in all but 1 condition), compared with existing, guideline-supported medications. The out-of-pocket and standardized total costs were substantially larger for new-to-market medications. The median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) out-of-pocket costs for a 30-day supply in 2019 were largest for edaravone ($712.8 [$59.8-$802.0]) and eculizumab ($91.1 [$3.0-$3,216.4]). For new-to-market medications, the distribution of out-of-pocket costs was highly variable and the trends over time were unpredictable compared with existing guideline-supported medications.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing number of FDA-approved neurologic medications, utilization of newly approved medications in the privately insured population remains small. Given the high costs and similar efficacy for most of the new medications, limited utilization may be appropriate. However, for new medications with greater efficacy, future studies are needed to determine whether high costs are a barrier to utilization.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by repeated headaches of varying intensity. The prevalence and severity of migraine headaches disproportionally affects women, particularly during the postpartum period. Moreover, migraines during pregnancy have been associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including preeclampsia and postpartum stroke. However, due to the lack of a validated instrument for uniform case ascertainment on postpartum migraine headache, there is uncertainty in the reported prevalence in the literature.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of reporting postpartum migraine headache coding in a large integrated health care system's electronic health records (EHRs) and to compare the coding quality before and after the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes and pharmacy records in EHRs.\n",
      "METHODS: Medical records of 200 deliveries in all 15 Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals during 2 time periods, that is, January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] coding period) and January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 (ICD-10-CM coding period), were randomly selected from EHRs for chart review. Two trained research associates reviewed the EHRs for all 200 women for postpartum migraine headache cases documented within 1 year after delivery. Women were considered to have postpartum migraine headache if either a mention of migraine headache (yes for diagnosis) or a prescription for treatment of migraine headache (yes for pharmacy records) was noted in the electronic chart. Results from the chart abstraction served as the gold standard and were compared with corresponding diagnosis and pharmacy prescription utilization records for both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding periods through comparisons of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), as well as the summary statistics of F-score and Youden J statistic (J). The kappa statistic (κ) for interrater reliability was calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: The overall agreement between the identification of migraine headache using diagnosis codes and pharmacy records compared to the medical record review was strong. Diagnosis coding (F-score=87.8%; J=82.5%) did better than pharmacy records (F-score=72.7%; J=57.5%) when identifying cases, but combining both of these sources of data produced much greater accuracy in the identification of postpartum migraine cases (F-score=96.9%; J=99.7%) with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 100%, 99.7%, 93.9%, and 100%, respectively. Results were similar across the ICD-9-CM (F-score=98.7%, J=99.9%) and ICD-10-CM coding periods (F-score=94.9%; J=99.6%). The interrater reliability between the 2 research associates for postpartum migraine headache was 100%.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Neither diagnostic codes nor pharmacy records alone are sufficient for identifying postpartum migraine cases reliably, but when used together, they are quite reliable. The completeness of the data remained similar after the implementation of the ICD-10-CM coding in the EHR system.\n",

Amplitude asymmetry ratio was significantly high in MD-affected ears when compared with the HC (p = 0.014), VM (p = 0.038), and RV (p = 0.045). VEMP latencies and lateral canal vHIT gain were not different between groups (p > 0.05). The percentage of correctly identified optotypes on fHIT of the MD (p > 0.001), VM (p = 0.004), and RV (p = 0.001) patients were low in comparison with the HC.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Apart from hearing loss, low cVEMP amplitudes on the affected side were the main feature in MD differentiating it from VM and RV. Vestibular test results of patients with RV and VM were similar. Low fHIT results in all groups indicate a functional deficit in gaze stabilization. Disabling vertigo attacks disturbing attention may be the cause of this functional impairment. MD, VM, and RV may be parts of a broad-spectrum disorder, RV patients representing milder forms not associated with cochlear or migrainous features.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to predict and anticipate others' behaviors through the mental state attribution process. This study aims to investigate the ToM in patients with medication-overuse headache (MOH) and episodic migraine (EM) and to compare it with healthy controls (HC).\n",
      "METHODS: This study enrolled patients with MOH, patients with EM, and HC. ToM was assessed through the Theory of Mind Assessment Scale (ThOMAS), which includes four subscales: Scale A, I-Me, Scale B, Other-Self, Scale C, I-Other, and Scale D, Other-Me, through the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), which measures complex emotion recognition, and through the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), which measures alexithymia. Concomitant psychiatric disturbances were evaluated through the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale-II.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study involved 21 patients with EM, 22 patients with MOH, and 18 HC. In all the four subscales of the ThOMAS, there was a significant difference between HC, EM, and MOH patients: Scale A (p = 0.009), Scale B (p = 0.004), Scale C (p = 0.039), and Scale D (p = 0.008). In the RMET, MOH patients had worse performances than EM patients and HC (p = 0.039). MOH group exhibited higher levels of alexithymia when compared to the HC (p = 0.033) and higher levels of anxiety than HC (p = 0.001).\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of an initial dose of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) antagonists on gastrointestinal (GI) motility in patients with migraine and to explore if the mechanistic difference contributes to GI adverse events (AEs).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Different frequencies of constipation have been observed between CGRP mAbs that target the ligand (galcanezumab [GMB]) or receptor (erenumab [ERE]).\n",
      "METHODS: Patients (n = 65) with migraine without significant GI symptoms were enrolled in a multi-center, single-blind phase IV clinical trial (NCT04294147) and randomized 1:1 to receive GMB (240 mg; n = 33) or ERE (140 mg; n = 32). GI whole and regional transit times were assessed using a wireless motility capsule 1 week before and 2 weeks after mAb administration. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in colonic transit time (CTT) within each treatment group. Other measures included GI Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) evaluation. AEs were monitored throughout the study.\n",
      "RESULTS: Baseline characteristics indicated significant GI transit time variability with minimal GI reported symptoms. While not statistically significant, a numerical mean increase in CTT was observed in ERE patients (n = 28, mean [SD] at baseline: 33.8 [29.4] h; least square [LS] mean [SE] change: 5.8 [5.7] h, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.7 to 17.2, p = 0.320), while GMB decreased CTT (n = 31, mean [SD] at baseline: 29.3 [24.5] h; LS mean [SE] change: -5.4 [5.4] h, 95% CI -16.2 to 5.5, p = 0.328) compared to baseline. No meaningful changes were observed in other regional transit times. ERE significantly reduced BSFS (LS mean [SE] score -0.5 [0.2], p = 0.004) and SBM (LS mean [SE] -1.2 [0.5], p = 0.0120), and increased GSRS-constipation compared to baseline (LS mean [SE] score 0.3 [0.1], p = 0.016). GMB increased GSRS-constipation (LS mean [SE] score 0.4 [0.1], p = 0.002). There were no discontinuations due to or serious AEs. A higher percentage of treatment-emergent AEs were reported with ERE than GMB (ERE: nine of 32 [28.1%] versus GMB: three of 33 [9.1%]), with constipation the most frequently reported (ERE: five of 32 [15.6%] versus GMB one of 33 [3.0%]).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: While the primary endpoint of this study was not met, secondary and tertiary endpoints support a within- and between-treatment change in GI effects suggesting possible mechanistic differences between ligand (GMB) and receptor (ERE) antagonism.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Previously 81% of military service members with PPTH demonstrated symptoms with SNR up to 60 seconds. Of these, 54% reported symptoms in one (Uni-Symp) and 46% in both directions of rotation (Bi-Symp). Sub-occipital PPTs, in relation to SNR direction, were of interest.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective review of records of 77 individuals, with PPTH with both SNR and PPTs. Average suboccipital and scalene PPTs were compared between Asymptomatic (n = 13), upon SNR testing, or Symptomatic (Uni-Symp, n = 32, Bi-Symp, n = 32), groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: The Bi-Symp group had significantly reduced sub-occipital PPTs relative to the Asymptomatic group on both sides [p < 0.009] with no side-to-side differences in either group. The Uni-Symp group had significantly lower sub-occipital PPTs on the symptomatic SNR test direction compared to the asymptomatic side [t(31) = 3.37, p = 0.002]. There were no differences within or between groups in the scalene PPTs(p's > 0.08).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: An upper cervical mechanical trigger of symptoms during SNR tests in some individuals with PPTH is possible. The direction of symptomatic SNR tests may indicate direction of guarded hypermobile dysfunction and direct treatment.\n",

There is a paucity of data, however, specifically regarding the efficacy of concomitant occipital artery resection. To that end, the goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of greater occipital nerve decompression with and without occipital artery resection.\n",
      "METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study consisted of two groups: an occipital artery resection group (artery identified and resected) and a control group (no occipital artery resection). Preoperative, 3-month, and 12-month migraine frequency, duration, intensity, Migraine Headache Index score, and complications were extracted and analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 94 patients underwent greater occipital nerve decompression and met all inclusion criteria, with 78 in the occipital artery resection group and 16 in the control group. The groups did not differ in any of the demographic factors or preoperative migraine frequency, duration, intensity, or Migraine Headache Index score. Postoperatively, both groups demonstrated a significant decrease in migraine frequency, duration, intensity, and Migraine Headache Index score. The decrease in Migraine Headache Index score was significantly greater among the occipital artery resection group than the control group ( p = 0.019). Patients in both groups had no major complications and a very low rate of minor complications.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Headache disorders are exceedingly common in children and adolescents. The association between headaches, emotional stress, and disruptions in daily routines are well established. The goal of this study is to compare the experiences of patients with a preexisting diagnosis of a primary headache disorder in terms of headache frequency and severity, lifestyle techniques for headache prevention, screen use, and mood from before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients evaluated by the Headache Clinic at Children's National Hospital between Summer 2020 and Winter 2021 were enrolled in a patient registry. Patients completed a questionnaire examining changes in headache characteristics and lifestyle factors since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 107 patients completed the survey. Since the pandemic's onset, patients reported decreased physical activity (n = 59, 55%), increased frequency of chronic headaches from 40% (N = 42) to 50% (N = 54), and increased constant daily headaches from 22% (n = 24) to 36% (n = 38). Patients reported worsened anxiety (n = 58, 54%), mood (n = 50, 47%), and workload (n = 49, 46%). Sixty-one percent (n = 65) of patients reported using screens for school for more than 6 hours per day. The majority (n = 67, 63%) of patients indicated that they would prefer attending in-person school, with 14% (n = 15) responding that they preferred online school.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, pediatric headache patients have experienced increasing headache frequency, worsening anxiety and mood, decreased physical activity, and increased screen usage. Although this study is limited by sample size and observational design, future population-based studies will further elucidate the impact of this pandemic on pediatric headache.\n",

The current study was designed to extract the main trigger factors using factor analysis, and compare the chronic and episodic patient scores for every extracted pattern.\n",
      "METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 300 migrainous women (25-55 years old) participated. A constructed 46-item Likert questionnaire was developed to assess the primary triggers. The validity of the designed questionnaire was assessed by Content Validity Ratio and Content Validity Index coefficients. The test-retest method was employed to assess reliability. The exploratory factor analysis was performed to extract patterns of correlation among 46 triggers. Each participant was given a score for every extracted pattern. The mean scores of chronic and episodic patients were compared using the Mann-Whitney test.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean body mass index of participants was 28.17 ± 5.44 kg/m2 . Most participants (90.7%) had migraine without aura. Four factors were extracted using factor analysis that explained 22.37% of the total variance: (1) environmental and behavioural factors; (2) condiments; (3) nitrite, tyramine and caffeine; and (4) fats. None of these factors explained the difference between chronic and episodic migrainous women.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that environmental and behavioural factors, relative to dietary triggers, play an essential role in causing migraine in women and more than dietary triggers. The most important triggers did not differ between episodic and chronic migrainous women.\n",

      "CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that delayed onset of symptoms in athletes were relatively common following SRC, supporting continued evaluation of athletes for several days following suspected injuries. Delayed onset of symptoms was associated with PTM, whereas immediate onset was associated with more pronounced vestibular dysfunction, suggesting that clinicians should consider the timing of symptom onset when assessing and treating athletes following SRC.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Recurrent dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance, as well as nausea or vomiting, can be induced by central or peripheral vestibular pathology. Vestibular migraine (VM) is a central pathology in which migraines reciprocally interact with vestibular nuclei. Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis (VN/L) are peripheral diseases involving inflammation of structures in the vestibular nerve or labyrinth. Because VM and VN/L in early stages can produce similar symptoms, diagnosis may require prolonged clinical evaluation. It has been suggested that differences in a patient's Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) measured during the rotary chair step rotation test (RCS Test) can differentiate VM from peripheral pathologies, allowing for faster diagnosis. We sought to compare VOR time constants (VORT<sub>c</sub>s) in patients with VM versus VN/L, with the goal of exploring potential diagnostic value.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients seen at a hospital balance center between January 2010 and June 2019.\n",
      "SETTING: Tertiary referral center.\n",
      "PATIENTS: 68 patients (mean age = 58.15, 65 % female, 35 % male) were placed into two groups based on clinical diagnosis codes: 1) VM or 2) VN/L.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary variable of VORT<sub>c</sub>, evoked by rotational step testing.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients in the VM group demonstrated statistically significant elevated VOR T<sub>c</sub>s outside the normed range of 10-19.5 compared to those in the VN/L group (p = 0.0003) while patients in the VN/L group demonstrated statistically significant shortened VOR T<sub>c</sub>s (p = 0.0443) with the two populations having distinctly different VOR T<sub>c</sub> profiles.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the conclusion that elevated VOR T<sub>c</sub>s are a sign of central vestibular pathology and highlight the benefit of utilizing rotary chair testing early in the diagnostic process as a powerful diagnostic tool when evaluating dizzy patients for central versus peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Our results suggest more particularly that elevated VOR T<sub>c</sub>s can be utilized to identify patients with vestibular migraine, thus offering differentiation from patients with peripheral vestibular dysfunction earlier in the process of diagnosis, with an opportunity for earlier intervention.\n",

      "METHODS: Thirty patients for each group [VM, PPPD and healthy volunteers (HC)] were studied. Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Beck depression and anxiety scales, Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8), Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF 36) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) were used.\n",
      "RESULTS: DHI sub-scores were significantly high in both patient groups in comparison with the HC (p < 0.001 for all). Emotional (p = 0.001) and functional (p = 0.022) sub-scores of the PPPD patients were worse. Anxiety and somatic symptom scores of VM (p = 0.026 and p < 0.001 respectively) and PPPD (p < 0.001 for both) and depression scores of the PPPD (p = 0.003) were higher than the HC.

      "RESULTS: Ninety-one patients with SCD met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. VM was diagnosed in 36 (39.6%) patients. Of those receiving medical therapy for VM alone, five (45.5%) reported symptom resolution, five (45.5%) reported partial improvement, one (9.1%) had no change, and none worsened. Fifteen patients (41.7%) were treated with both surgery (for SCD) and medical therapy (for VM). Seven (46.7%) reported symptom resolution, seven (46.7%) reported partial improvement, and one (6.7%) worsened. There was no statistically significant difference in symptom resolution between SCD + VM patients who were treated medically compared with those treated with medical therapy and surgery (p = 0.951). There was no significant difference in symptom resolution after surgery between SCD + VM and SCD-only cohorts (p = 0.286).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing the incidence of VM in a cohort of patients with SCDS. The symptoms of VM confound those of SCDS and unrecognized or undertreated VM may contribute to surgical failure in SCDS. Therefore, we recommend a high index of suspicion for VM in patients with SCDS and a trial of medical therapy in the setting of suspected VM.\n",

They were randomized to the intervention group receiving oral propranolol (1-3 mg/kg/d, BID) and the control group receiving a similar looking, inert, oral placebo for migraine prophylaxis for 3 mo. The number of migraine attacks over the 3-mo follow-up (using a headache diary) was the primary outcome. Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (PedMIDAS) was used for assessing disability and Visual analogue scale was used for assessing headache severity. Analysis was done on intention-to-treat basis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty children (10 in each group) completed the study. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both the study drugs produced significant reduction of headache frequency after the study intervention (p = 0.002). However, there was no difference between the two groups with respect to either the median (IQR) number of headache attacks [22 (20, 25) vs. 14 (10, 20); p = 0.05], headache severity [1 (0, 1) vs. 0.5 (0, 1); p = 0.48] or migraine disability [39.5 (28, 44) vs. 35 (22, 38); p = 0.27]. Adverse effects were higher in the intervention group (p = 0.52).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol was effective for migraine prophylaxis in children but the effect was not higher than placebo. Larger placebo-controlled trials of propranolol need to be conducted to decide its place in migraine prophylaxis in children.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical phenotype of patients with chronic migraine (CM) to patients with new daily persistent headache of the chronic migraine subtype (NDPH-CM).\n",
      "METHODS: A study was conducted of CM (n = 257) and NDPH-CM (n = 76) from a tertiary headache center in the UK, and in the US of patients with daily CM (n = 60) and NDPH-CM (n = 22).\n",
      "RESULTS: From the UK cohort, the age of first headache onset was lower in CM (mean ± SD: 16 ± 12 years) than in NDPH-CM (mean ± SD: 23 ± 14 years; p < 0.001). There was a greater number of associated migrainous symptoms in CM compared to NDPH-CM (median and interquartile range: 6, 5-8 vs. 5, 4-7; p < 0.001). A family history of headache was more common in CM compared to NDPH-CM (82%, 202/248, vs. 53%, 31/59; p < 0.001). In the US cohort there were no differences. Osmophobia (B = -1.08; p = 0.002) and older age at presentation to the clinic (B = -0.06; p = 0.001) were negative predictors of NDPH-CM.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: NDPH-CM is relatively less migrainous than CM in the UK cohort. Family history of headache is less common in NDPH-CM, with negative predictors for NDPH-CM including osmophobia and older age of presentation to the clinic. More work is required to understand the chronic migraine phenotype of new daily persistent headache.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine, one of the most common headaches in children, has a significant impact on children and their family's quality of life (QoL). There are two approaches for controlling migraine headaches preventative and controlling acute attacks. Several drugs have been used for this purpose, and tricyclic antidepressants were at the top. Amitriptyline has shown not only a desirable effect on controlling the headaches but also some adverse side effects. Recently, finding effective drugs with fewer side effects, become more critical. Among them, nutraceuticals were one of the promising ones.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial on 72 patients aged 5-15 years old with diagnosis of migraine based on the International Headache Society criteria, we compare the effectiveness of coenzyme Qten on frequency, duration, and severity of childhood migraine. For comparing the QoL, we used the International PedMIDAS questionnaire.\n",
      "RESULTS: Coenzyme Qten showed good therapeutic effects in children, especially in long-term use; however, amitriptyline showed more rapid response. After 3 months of treatment, clinical outcomes in the two groups did not significantly differ from each other. Similarly, Children's QoL increased in the same way. There are more reported side effects in children using amitriptyline compared to coenzyme Qten.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: According to results, Co-enzyme Q10, with fewer side effects and comparable therapeutic effects, especially in the long term, could be a good drug for prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine (CM) is one of the most disabling neurological diseases, often associated to medication overuse headache (MOH). These patients make high use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, and experience high work-related indirect costs. The aim of this study was to address and compare the main driver of cost associated to CM-MOH and EM, and to evaluate the effect of improvement in migraine profile on disease cost.\n",
      "METHODS: We selected patients with baseline CM-MOH who reverted to an episodic pattern by 3 months after structured withdrawal. Paired sample t-test was used to explore the variation in headache frequency and its costs. Regression models were run to address the impact of single cost categories on total migraine cost.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 261 patients were included. Significant reductions in headache frequency and its costs were observed, with the exception of medical prophylaxis cost. The cost of migraine from chronic to episodic pattern is reduced by 533€ per month and 80% of this reduction is accountable to reduced indirect costs, i.e., loss of productive time.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study open to future considerations on future approaches to the treatment of CM-MOH in which new migraine-specific treatments, i.e., monoclonal antibodies, should be combined with other pharmacological and non-pharmacological ones.\n",

      "METHODS: A total of 110 patients with migraine of liver yang hyperactivity were randomly divided into an electroacupuncture group (55 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a western medication group (55 cases, 2 cases dropped off). In the electroacupuncture group, electroacupuncture was applied at Siguan points (Hegu [LI 4] and Taichong [LR 3]), with disperse-dense wave of 2 Hz/100 Hz in frequency and current intensity of 0.1-1 mA, 30 min each time, once a day, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Flunarizine hydrochloride capsule was given orally in the western medication group, 10 mg a day for 4 weeks. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the migraine attack days were observed before and after treatment, during follow-up of 1, 3 and 6 months, and the migraine symptom score was observed before and after treatment in the two groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: After treatment, during follow-up of 1, 3 and 6 months, the VAS scores and the migraine attack days in the two groups were decreased compared with before treatment (Ｐ&lt;0.05), and above indexes in the electroacupuncture group were lower than the western medication group (Ｐ&lt;0.05). After treatment, the migraine symptom scores in the two groups were decreased (Ｐ&lt;0.05), the change in the electroacupuncture group was greater than the western medication group (Ｐ&lt;0.05).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Refractory chronic migraine is a common and debilitating neurologic condition, affecting over 8 million people in the United States. It is associated with billions of dollars in lost productivity annually. Novel medical (anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies) and surgical treatment modalities have emerged for chronic migraine in recent years. The current study investigated the cost-utility of surgical versus medical management of refractory chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: A Markov cohort analysis using hybrid Monte Carlo patient simulation was performed to compare surgical decompression versus erenumab for the treatment of refractory chronic migraine in adults. Both societal and payer perspectives were considered. Primary model outcomes included incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, or cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.\n",
      "RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, migraine surgery was associated with an increase of 0.2 quality-adjusted life-year per patient when compared to erenumab. In terms of costs, the results demonstrated a $19,337 decrease in direct medical costs and a $491 decrease in indirect costs (productivity lost) for the surgery cohort compared to erenumab. Because surgery improved quality of life and decreased costs compared to erenumab, even when considering revision surgery needs, surgery was the overall dominant treatment in terms of cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that surgery was cost-effective compared to erenumab when patients required therapy for at least 1 year.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Surgical deactivation of migraine trigger sites may pose a cost-effective approach to treating refractory chronic migraine in adults. This is especially the case when patients are anticipated to require therapy for more than 1 year.\n",

Three groups were identify based on type headache: 1) both episodic migraine and cervicogenic headache with neck pain; 2) episodic migraine only; 3) neck pain only. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain syndrome, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Neck Disability Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and numbers days with analgesics intake were assessment.\n",
      "RESULTS: Results: In patients, who suffered on episodic migraine combine with cervicogenic headache and neck pain number days with headache was more (p=0.000052), intensity attack was higher (p=0.003750) and number days with analgesics intake was greater (p=0.000003), compare with group with migraine only. The depression and anxiety state was more significant in patients with migraine and co-occurring neck pain comparable with migraine alone, but we found no significance differences between groups with migraine with neck pain and neck pain only.

      "BACKGROUND: Options for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine are limited and costly. Combination treatments do not have an evidence base yet.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a parallel group, 3 arms with 1:1:1 allocation ratio randomized controlled study in consecutive adult chronic migraine patients attending Headache Clinic in a tertiary care hospital. Patients received either topiramate monotherapy 100 mg/day (group A), or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) and 80mg (2 ml) methylprednisolone as the first injection followed by monthly injections of lidocaine for the next 2 months (group B) or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) injections monthly for 3 months (group C). The primary endpoint was the mean change in monthly migraine days at Month 3. Multiple secondary endpoints were assessed that included among others, achievement of ≥50% reduction in mean monthly headache days compared to baseline at Month 3 and assessment for any adverse events.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five patients were randomized; 41 to group A, 44 to group B, and 40 to group C. Efficacy assessments were done for 121 patients. Patients receiving combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block with steroids and lidocaine and greater occipital nerve block with only lidocaine compared to topiramate monotherapy showed greater reductions in monthly migraine days at Month 3 (-9.6 vs -7.3 days; p = 0.003) and (-10.1 vs -7.3 days; p < 0.001) respectively. Greater proportion of patients in both the combination treatment groups (added greater occipital nerve block with and without steroid) achieved ≥50% reduction in mean monthly headache days [71.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 3.9(1.6-9.8); p = 0.004] and [62.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 2.7(1.1-6.7); p = 0.034] respectively, compared to those receiving topiramate monotherapy. Adverse effects between the groups were comparable although patients receiving combination treatment with added greater occipital nerve block reported transient adverse effects like post-injection dizziness, local site swelling, and pain. No serious adverse event was reported.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a common headache disorder. Many studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the possible pathogenesis of migraine, but they have not reached consistent conclusions and lack rigorous multiple comparison correction. Thus, this study investigates the mechanisms of migraine development from the perspective of altered functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions by using data-driven and regions of interest (ROI)-based approaches.\n",
      "METHODS: Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 30 patients with migraine and 40 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age, gender, and years of education. For the data-driven method, we used a voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) approach to compare the FC between the patients and HCs. For the ROI-based method, significant differences in VMHC maps between the patients and HCs were defined as ROI. The seed-based approach further revealed significant differences in FC between the seeds and the other brain regions. Furthermore, the correlations between abnormal FC and clinical characteristics of patients were investigated. A rigorous multiple comparison correction was used with false discovery rate and permutation test (5000 times).\n",
      "RESULTS: In comparison with the controls group, patients showed enhanced VMHC in the bilateral thalamus. We also observed enhanced FC between the left thalamus and the left superior frontal gyrus, and increased FC between the right thalamus and the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 45 and Brodmann area 8) in patients. Further analysis showed that the FC values in the left superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus were negatively corrected with visual analogue scale scores or attack times for headaches.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with migraine showed altered VMHC in the bilateral thalamus, and abnormal FC of bilateral thalamus and other brain regions. The abnormalities in thalamic FC are a likely mechanism for the development of migraine.\n",

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the choroid plexus volume in MS and NMOSD.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, patients were included by convenience sampling from 4 international MS centers. The choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles was segmented fully automatically on T1-weighted MRI sequences using a deep learning algorithm (Multi-Dimensional Gated Recurrent Units). Uni- and multivariable linear models were applied to investigate associations between the choroid plexus volume, clinically meaningful disease characteristics, and MRI parameters.\n",

The choroid plexus volume was larger in MS (median 1,690 µL, interquartile range [IQR] 648 µL) than in NMOSD (median 1,403 µL, IQR 510 µL), healthy individuals (median 1,533 µL, IQR 570 µL), and patients with migraine (median 1,404 µL, IQR 524 µL; all p &lt; 0.001), whereas there was no difference between NMOSD, migraine, and healthy controls. This was also true when adjusted for age, sex, and the intracranial volume. In contrast to NMOSD, the choroid plexus volume in MS was associated with the number of T2-weighted lesions in a linear model adjusted for age, sex, total intracranial volume, disease duration, relapses in the year before MRI, disease course, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, disease-modifying treatment, and treatment duration (beta 4.4; 95% CI 0.78-8.1; p = 0.018).\n",
      "DISCUSSION: This study supports an involvement of the choroid plexus in MS in contrast to NMOSD and provides clues to better understand the respective pathogenesis.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Otalgia can be primary/otogenic or secondary as a referred pain from another site, which can be difficult to establish owing to various causes and the complex innervation of the ear. In our center, we observed a large group of patients with unexplained otalgia that had a higher prevalence of migraine. We hypothesized that migraine may cause secondary otalgia. This study then aimed to determine the prevalence of migraine-associated otalgia and evaluate the efficacy of migraine treatment.\n",
      "SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This 2-year retrospective study was conducted at a busy otology clinic. Patients were identified using diagnostic codes corresponding to otalgia. The prevalence of migraine-associated otalgia was determined, and the efficacy of migraine treatment was evaluated in these patients. The interventions included prophylactic and abortive migraine treatments. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare between the pre- and post-treatment symptoms.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 208 patients with otalgia were identified. Sixty-four out of ninety patients with unexplained otalgia met the criteria for migraine; of them, 30 patients had an adequate follow-up and were thus included in the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Otalgia improved in 87% of the patients who received migraine treatment. After treatment, the mean pain score and headache frequency significantly decreased from 7 to 2 and from 27 to 9 days per month, respectively (p<0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine should be considered as a source of secondary otalgia, and patients should receive treatment as they often respond to migraine treatment.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Current pharmacologic prophylactic strategies for migraine have exhibited limited efficacy, with response rates as low as 40%-50%. In addition to the limited efficacy, the acceptability of those pharmacologic prophylactic strategies were unacceptable. Although noninvasive brain/nerve stimulation strategies may be effective, the evidence has been inconsistent. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare strategies of noninvasive brain/nerve stimulation for migraine prophylaxis with respect to their effectiveness and acceptability.\n",
      "METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov , ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched to date of June 4th, 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Patients with diagnosis of migraine, either episodic migraine or chronic migraine, were included. All NMA procedures were conducted under the frequentist model.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs were included (N = 1493; mean age = 38.2 years; 82.0% women). We determined that the high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over C3 yielded the most decreased monthly migraine days among all the interventions [mean difference = - 8.70 days, 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs): - 14.45 to - 2.95 compared to sham/control groups]. Only alternating frequency (2/100 Hz) transcutaneous occipital nerve stimulation (tONS) over the Oz (RR = 0.36, 95%CIs: 0.16 to 0.82) yielded a significantly lower drop-out rate than the sham/control groups did.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The current study provided a new direction for the design of more methodologically robust and larger RCTs based on the findings of the potentially beneficial effect on migraine prophylaxis in participants with migraine by different noninvasive brain/nerve stimulation, especially the application of rTMS and tONS.\n",

      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of index characteristics and acute postpartum, nonelective rehospitalizations from the 2015-2017 National Readmissions Database using ICD-10 codes. Wald χ2 testing compared baseline demographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics and postpartum complications between WWN (including previous stroke, migraine, multiple sclerosis [MS], and myasthenia gravis [MG]) and controls. Multivariable logistic regression models examined odds of postpartum complications and nonelective readmissions within 30 and 90 days for each neurologic comorbidity compared to controls (α = 0.05).\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 7,612 women with previous stroke, 83,430 women with migraine, 6,760 women with MS, 843 women with MG, and 8,136,335 controls met the criteria for index admission after viable infant delivery. WWN were more likely than controls to have inpatient diagnoses of edema, proteinuria, or hypertensive disorders and to have received maternal care for poor fetal growth. The adjusted odds of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe maternal morbidity indicator were greater for women with previous stroke (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.53, 95% CI 7.24-10.06), migraine (AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.85-2.26), and MG (AOR 4.45, 95% CI 2.45-8.08) (all p &lt; 0.0001). Readmission rates at 30 and 90 days for WWN were higher than for controls (30 days: previous stroke 2.9%, migraine 1.7%, MS 1.8%, MG 4.3%, controls 1.1%; 90 days: previous stroke 3.7%, migraine 2.5%, MS 5.1%, MG 6.0%, controls 1.6%). Women with MG had the highest adjusted odds of readmission (30 days: AOR 3.96, 95% CI 2.37-6.65, p &lt; 0.0001; 90 days: AOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.88-5.78, p &lt; 0.0001).\n",
      "DISCUSSION: WWN may be at higher risk of severe maternal morbidity at the time of index delivery and postpartum readmission. More real-world evidence is needed to develop research infrastructure and create efficacious interventions to optimize maternal-fetal outcomes in WWN, especially for women with previous stroke or MG.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To quantify and compare healthcare utilization and costs for patients with chronic migraine (CM), episodic migraine (EM), and tension-type headache (TTH) enrolled in US commercial health plans.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart database from January 2015 to December 2018. Adult patients with a diagnosis of EM, CM or TTH and at least 12 months of continuous enrollment before and after diagnosis were included. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline differences among the three groups. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, and healthcare utilization and costs during follow-up, were described and compared between the three groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 45,849 patients were included: 8955 with CM, 31,961 with EM, and 4933 with TTH. The total all-cause annual direct medical costs of patients with CM ($17,878) were 1.38 times higher (95% CI: 1.31-1.44) than those with EM ($12,986), and 2.26 times higher (95% CI: 2.08-2.47) than those with TTH ($7902). The annual migraine/TTH-related costs of patients with CM ($1869) were 4.19 times higher (95% CI: 3.92-4.48) than those with EM ($446), and 11.90 times (95% CI: 10.59-13.52) higher than those with TTH ($157). In the adjusted analyses, for all service categories (emergency department, inpatient, outpatient, and prescriptions), the expected costs in the migraine groups were higher than in the TTH group (all p < 0.001), while controlling for covariates. Main findings were consistent in both weighted and unweighted samples, and with both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study provides an updated assessment of healthcare utilization and expenditures for adult patients with primary headache disorders. Compared to TTH, migraine is associated with higher resource use and direct medical costs, especially for those with a chronic condition. Future studies are needed to understand the indirect medical costs (productivity loss) and humanistic burden (quality of life) between migraine and TTH.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by intense, debilitating headaches, often coupled with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Whilst changes in sensory processes during a migraine attack have been well-described, there is growing evidence that even between migraine attacks, sensory abilities are disrupted in migraine. Brain imaging studies have investigated altered coupling between areas of the descending pain modulatory pathway but coupling between somatosensory processing regions between migraine attacks has not been properly studied. The aim of this study was to determine if ongoing functional connectivity between visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory and somatosensory cortices are altered during the interictal phase of migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: To explore the neural mechanisms underpinning interictal changes in sensory processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare resting brain activity patterns and connectivity in migraineurs between migraine attacks (n = 32) and in healthy controls (n = 71). Significant differences between groups were determined using two-sample random effects procedures (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, minimum cluster size 10 contiguous voxels, age and gender included as nuisance variables).\n",
      "RESULTS: In the migraine group, increases in infra-slow oscillatory activity were detected in the right primary visual cortex (V1), secondary visual cortex (V2) and third visual complex (V3), and left V3. In addition, resting connectivity analysis revealed that migraineurs displayed significantly enhanced connectivity between V1 and V2 with other sensory cortices including the auditory, gustatory, motor and somatosensory cortices.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence for a dysfunctional sensory network in pain-free migraine patients which may be underlying altered sensory processing between migraine attacks.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2Δa) that selectively targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is approved for migraine prevention in adults. Real-world data on the effectiveness of fremanezumab are limited. This retrospective, observational cohort study assessed patient-reported migraine symptoms, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and direct medical costs before and after fremanezumab treatment initiation.\n",
      "METHODS: Data were extracted from September 2018 through June 2020 from the Midwest component of EMRClaims+®, an integrated health services database containing > 20 million medical records from national commercial insurance claims, Medicare claims, and regional electronic medical records. Patients included in the cohort analysis were aged ≥ 18 years and were administered fremanezumab, with enrollment or treatment history for ≥ 6 months prior (pre-index) to initiating fremanezumab (index date) and ≥ 1 month after the index date (post-index), and without pregnancy or pregnancy-related encounters during the study period. Patient-reported headache frequency, migraine pain intensity (MPI), composite migraine symptoms, and HCRU were assessed pre-index and ≥ 1 month after fremanezumab initiation. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare means of migraine symptoms and outcomes and HCRU before and after fremanezumab initiation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall, 172 patients were eligible for analysis. Of patients who self-reported (n = 129), 83.7% reported improvement in headache frequency or symptoms after fremanezumab treatment. Specifically, headache frequency decreased by 63% after fremanezumab initiation: mean (standard deviation) headache frequency was 22.24 (9.29) days per month pre-index versus 8.24 (7.42) days per month post-index (P < 0.0001). Mean MPI also decreased by 18% after fremanezumab initiation: MPI was 5.47 (3.19) pre-index versus 4.51 (3.34) post-index (P = 0.014). Mean emergency room (ER) visits per month decreased from 0.72 to 0.54 (P = 0.003), and mean outpatient visits per month decreased from 1.04 to 0.81 (P < 0.001). Mean hospitalizations per month decreased, but the results did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.095). Hospitalization and ER costs decreased, while outpatient costs increased, from pre-index to post-index, but differences were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.232).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in headache frequency, MPI, and HCRU were observed after fremanezumab initiation in patients with migraine in a US real-world setting.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of HS in a large population-based cohort in the Northern Netherlands, and to compare patients with HS to the general population, investigate characteristics and identify potential associated comorbidities.\n",
      "METHODS: Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey-based study within the Lifelines Cohort Study (n = 167 729), based on the general population located in the Northern Netherlands. A digital self-reported questionnaire was developed consisting of validated questions for determining HS.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 56 084 respondents, the overall prevalence of HS was 2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-2.2]. The respondents with HS had lower socioeconomic status than the controls (P < 0.001) and more frequently currently smoked (P < 0.001). Several new significant associations in patients with HS were revealed, such as fibromyalgia (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.64-3.11), irritable bowel syndrome (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.26), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.06-2.78) and migraine (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.96). Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome remained significantly associated with HS in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status and socioeconomic status.\n",

Prophylaxis should be considered when symptoms cause frequent school absenteeism, poor quality of life, recurring emergency room visits, and frequent analgesic use. We aimed to compare the efficacy and side effects of drugs used in migraine prophylaxis, chosen according to the clinical and/or demographic characteristics of the patients.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred eighty-six patients aged 6-18 years were evaluated and who were diagnosed with migraine according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition beta version (ICH-3β). Propranolol, topiramate, flunarizine, and cyproheptadine were given as prophylactic treatment. The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS) score, severity, duration, and frequency of the headache attacks were evaluated from the medical records and pre- and post-treatment values were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 14 years (range, 6-18 years) and the mean duration of headache was 29.6 ± 21.02 months. The mean PedMIDAS score was 29.9 ± 21.2 before and 14.9 ± 12.5 after treatment. Most reduction in the frequency of attacks was observed in the topiramate group.

Patients with VM complain about vestibular symptoms during a headache attack or during the period between attacks. Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR), an exercised based therapy to treat dizziness and balance dysfunction has been shown to be effective in vestibular diseases. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of VR for vestibular symptoms and quality of life in VM patients, and to compare the results with patients with vestibular disorders without migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: Sixty (60) patients who received VR treatment were divided into two groups: vestibular migraine group (30 patients) and non-migraine vestibular dysfunction group (30 patients). All patients received VR for 18 sessions and the program was completed in 1.5 months. Pre- and post-treatment Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL) scores, the frequency of dizziness and headache, and Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) scores were assessed and compared retrospectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: With VR in both the vestibular migraine group and vestibular dysfunction group, DHI score, VADL score, the frequency of dizziness and headache scores significantly impaired. Post-treatment CDP results were higher than pre- treatment results for both patient groups.\n",

Besides, CS with migraine and non-migrainous headache were compared in terms of GI symptoms and accompanied conditions.\n",
      "RESULTS: Headache was more common in CS than controls (34% vs 27% respectively, P value<0.001) and more prevalent in females (71.9% in females vs 28% in males, P value = 0.004). Moreover, the prevalence of migraine in CS was higher than controls (20.7 vs 11.9% respectively, P value<0.001). Furthermore, migraine was more prevalent in females with CD (80% in females vs 19% in males, P value = 0.033), and often without aura (76%). Abdominal pain (76.9%, P value = 0.025), diarrhea (54.9%, P value = 0.002), and constipation (42.9%, P value = 0.011) were the most common GI symptoms in CS with headache and more prevalent in CS with migraine. Conversely, type 1 diabetes mellitus was less common in CS with migraine than in CS with non-migrainous headache. (P value = 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.22-1.83, P value < 0.001), and CD (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.12-1.65, P value = 0.002) were independent predictors of headache, whereas age more than 60 years (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.50-0.97, P value = 0.032) had a protective effect.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Since the data regarding the efficacy of greater occipital in episodic migraines are rare, we aimed to examine the efficacy of greater occipital block in the prophylaxis of episodic migraines without aura and compare different injectable drug regimens.\n",
      "METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, adult patients suffering from episodic migraines without aura were randomized to one of the following: triamcinolone, lidocaine, triamcinolone plus lidocaine, and saline. Patients were assessed at baseline, one week, two weeks, and four weeks after the injection for severity and duration of headaches and side effects.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-five patients completed the study. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the severity and duration decreased significantly after the greater occipital block (P < 0.001, P = 0.001 respectively) in all four groups. However, there was no difference between groups at any study time points (P > 0.05). In paired sample T-test, only groups 2 and 3 with lidocaine as a part of the injection showed a significant decrease in frequency compared to the baseline (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Three patients reported side effects with a possible association with triamcinolone.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Greater occipital block with a local anesthetic significantly decreases the number of attacks in episodic migraine, whereas no injection was superior to the placebo in regards to the duration and severity of the headaches.Trial Registration Information: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT).

      "CONTEXT: The King-Devick (K-D) test is used to identify oculomotor impairment after concussion. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the K-D test over time has not been evaluated.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To (1) examine the sensitivity and specificity of the K-D test at 0 to 6 hours postinjury, 24 to 48 hours postinjury, the beginning of a return-to-play (RTP) protocol (asymptomatic), unrestricted RTP, and 6 months postconcussion and (2) compare outcomes between athletes with and those without concussion across confounding factors (sex, age, sport contact level, academic year, learning disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, migraine history, concussion history, and test administration mode).\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional design.\n",
      "SETTING: Multiple institutions in the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium.\n",
      "PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 athletes with a concussion (162 men, 158 women; age = 19.80 ± 1.41 years) were compared with 1239 total collegiate athletes without a concussion (646 men, 593 women; age = 20.31 ± 1.18 years).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We calculated the K-D test time difference (in seconds) by subtracting the baseline from the most recent time. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy across time points. We identified cutoff scores and corresponding specificity at both the 80% and 70% sensitivity levels. We repeated ROC with AUC analyses using confounding factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: The K-D test predicted positive results at the 0- to 6-hour (AUC = 0.724, P < .001), 24- to 48-hour (AUC = 0.701, P < .001), RTP (AUC = 0.640, P < .001), and 6-month postconcussion (AUC = 0.615, P < .001) tim points but not at the asymptomatic time point (AUC = 0.513, P = .497). The 0- to 6-hour and 24- to 48-hour time points yielded 80% sensitivity cutoff scores of -2.6 and -3.2 seconds (ie, faster), respectively, but 46% and 41% specificity, respectively. The K-D test had a better AUC when administered using an iPad (AUC = 0.800, 95% CI = 0.747, 0.854) compared with the spiral-bound card system (AUC = 0.646, 95% CI = 0.600, 0.692; P < .001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of the K-D test was greatest at 0 to 6 hours and 24 to 48 hours postconcussion but declined across subsequent postconcussion time points. The AUCs did not differentiate between groups across confounding factors. Our negative cutoff scores indicated that practice effects contributed to improved performance, requiring athletes to outperform their baseline scores.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: A recent study showed that 60-s paranasal air suction results in an immediate pain relief in acute migraine. This is the study to assess the Nitric Oxide (NO) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentration in nasal-paranasal sinus air of migraine patients and to compare it with healthy controls.\n",
      "METHODOLOGY: The NO and CO levels of air sucked out from nasal-paranasal sinuses of 20 migraine adolescent and young adults among school students, aged 16 -19 years, and 22 healthy similar aged school students as controls were measured as key responses using a portable NO and a portable CO analyzer.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients had comparatively high values compared to the controls for paranasal NO (both left and right sides), paranasal CO (both left and right sides), Fraction Exhaled NO (FeNO) and Fraction Exhaled CO (FeCO). Patients had median paranasal NO contents of 132.5 ppb and 154 ppb on left and right sides respectively compared to 36 ppb and 34.5 ppb corresponding values in controls (P <  0.0001). Similar pattern was observed with paranasal CO (P <  0.0001). FeNO and FeCO content were also higher in patients (P <  0.0001). Receiver characteristic operating curves of all gas measurements showed that they all could classify patients and controls effectively and NO was the most effective followed by paranasal CO. After air suction, the mean pain scores of general headache and tenderness dropped by a very large margin in migraine patients (P <  0.0001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Suctioned out high nasal-paranasal sinus NO and CO levels can be used to distinguish migraine patients from healthy subjects. In fact, suctioned out paranasal NO measurements of both sides with a cutoff point of 50 ppb provided a perfect classification of patients and controls. Increased sinus NO and CO during acute episode of migraine is an observation we had and we agree that further studies are needed to conclude that NO and CO can be a causative molecule for migraine headache.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To describe concussion characteristics among general college students and compare postinjury outcomes to intercollegiate student athletes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.\n",
      "SETTING: Large university in the Southeast region of the United States.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 179 (N=179) college students' (female=120; 67.0%; 23.9±3.9 years) and 49 athletes' (female=28, 57.1%;19.3±1.3 years) medical records were examined. Participants self-reported injury mechanism, health history information, and completed clinical assessments acutely (<7 days postinjury).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were calculated for each group. Concussion outcomes between students with and without certain health history diagnoses were assessed using separate t tests. We conducted univariate regression analyses to determine if sex, age, and time from concussion to first clinical assessment were significant predictors of clinical outcomes. Statistically significant variables were included as covariates in a series of 1-way analyses of covariance to identify differences in balance, symptom severity, total symptom presence, and neurocognitive domain performance between students and athletes. Fisher exact tests were used to compare health history information between groups (α<0.05).\n",
      "RESULTS: Among students, 24% reported sustaining a concussion while participating in recreational sports, and 27% of impacts occurred to the back of the head. Students had higher proportions of headache, migraine, anxiety, and depression (P<.05). Students reported greater total symptom presence (P=.006) and performed worse on the computerized neurocognitive test domain score for complex attention (P=.015) relative to athletes.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need for better access to medical care for non- National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctioned athletes because of a large proportion of concussions in the student sample being sustained during sports participation. Identifying common injury mechanisms can provide clinicians with powerful information to improve evaluation and treatment models.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: To compare symptoms of clinical androgen deficiency between men with migraine, men with cluster headache and non-headache male controls.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using two validated questionnaires to assess symptoms of androgen deficiency in males with migraine, cluster headache, and non-headache controls. Primary outcome was the mean difference in androgen deficiency scores. Generalized linear models were used adjusting for age, BMI, smoking and lifetime depression. As secondary outcome we assessed the percentage of patients reporting to score below average on four sexual symptoms (beard growth, morning erections, libido and sexual potency) as these items were previously shown to more specifically differentiate androgen deficiency symptoms from (comorbid) anxiety and depression.\n",
      "RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by n = 534/853 (63%) men with migraine, n = 437/694 (63%) men with cluster headache and n = 152/209 (73%) controls. Responders were older compared to non-responders and more likely to suffer from lifetime depression. Patients reported more severe symptoms of clinical androgen deficiency compared with controls, with higher AMS scores (Aging Males Symptoms; mean difference ± SE: migraine 5.44 ± 0.90, p <  0.001; cluster headache 5.62 ± 0.99, p <  0.001) and lower qADAM scores (quantitative Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male; migraine: - 3.16 ± 0.50, p <  0.001; cluster headache: - 5.25 ± 0.56, p <  0.001). Additionally, both patient groups more often reported to suffer from any of the specific sexual symptoms compared to controls (18.4% migraine, 20.6% cluster headache, 7.2% controls, p = 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Men with migraine and cluster headache more often suffer from symptoms consistent with clinical androgen deficiency than males without a primary headache disorder.\n",

      "PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data that directly compares the falls rate and dizziness handicap of different vestibular diagnoses. The purpose of this study is to compare the falls rate and dizziness handicap of common vestibular diagnoses encountered among a cohort of vestibular patients at a single institution.\n",
      "METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients evaluated for dizziness at a tertiary care center vestibular clinic between August 1, 2017, and March 19, 2019. Vestibular diagnosis, demographic variables, comorbidities, falls status, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) were extracted from the medical record for analysis. Associations between vestibular diagnosis and falls history or DHI were evaluated using multivariate logistic and linear regression, respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 283 patients met our inclusion criteria with the following diagnoses: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; n = 55), acoustic neuroma (n = 30), Ménière's disease (n = 28), multiple vestibular diagnoses (n = 15), vestibular migraine (n = 135), or vestibular neuritis (n = 20). After adjusting for age, sex, race, medications, and comorbidities, the odds of falling was 2.47 times greater (95% CI [1.08, 6.06], p = .039) and the DHI score was 11.66 points higher (95% CI [4.99, 18.33], p &lt; .001) in those with vestibular migraine compared to those with BPPV. Other diagnoses were comparable to BPPV with respect to odds of falling and dizziness handicap.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with vestibular migraine may suffer an increased risk of falls and dizziness handicap compared to patients with BPPV. Our findings highlight the need for timely evaluation and treatment of all patients with vestibular disease.\n",

      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) for freedom from pain (hereafter referred to as pain freedom) at 2 hours after the dose, and the secondary outcomes were ORs for pain relief at 2 hours after the dose and any adverse events.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 64 randomized clinical trials were included (46 442 participants; 74%-87% women; age range, 36-43 years). Most of the included treatments were associated with reduced pain at 2 hours compared with placebo. Most triptans were associated with higher ORs for pain freedom at 2 hours compared with lasmiditan (range: OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.06-2.80] to OR, 3.40 [95% CI, 2.12-5.44]), rimegepant (range: OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.07-2.33] to OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 2.16-4.52]), and ubrogepant (range: OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.00-2.37] to OR, 3.05 [95% CI, 2.02-4.60]). Most triptans were associated with higher ORs for pain relief at 2 hours compared with lasmiditan (range: OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.09-1.96] to OR, 3.31 [95% CI, 2.41-4.55]), rimegepant (range: OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01-1.76] to OR, 3.01 [95% CI, 2.33-3.88]), and ubrogepant (range: OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.02-1.88] to OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 2.35-4.15]). The comparisons between lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant were not statistically significant for both pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours. Lasmiditan was associated with the highest risk of any adverse events, and certain triptans (rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan) were also associated with a higher risk of any adverse events than the calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For pain freedom or pain relief at 2 hours after the dose, lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant were associated with higher ORs compared with placebo but lower ORs compared with most triptans. However, the lack of cardiovascular risks for these new classes of migraine-specific treatments may offer an alternative to triptans.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is mostly a female disorder because of its lower prevalence in men. Less than 20% of patients included in the available studies on migraine treatments are men; hence, the evidence on migraine treatments might not apply to men. The aims of the present study were to provide reliable information on the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BT-A) for chronic migraine in men and to compare clinical benefits between men and women.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a pooled patient-level gender-specific analysis of real-life data on BT-A for chronic migraine of patients followed-up to 9 months. We reported the 50% responder rates during each BT-A cycle, defined as percentage of reduction in monthly headache days (MHDs) compared to baseline, along with 75% and 30% responder rates. We also reported the mean decrease in MHDs and in days of acute medication use (DAMs) during each BT-A cycle as compared to baseline. We also evaluated the reasons for stopping the treatment within the third cycle.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included an overall cohort of 2879 patients, 522 of whom (18.1%) were men. In men, 50% responder rates were 27.7% during the first BT-A cycle, 29.2% during the second, and 35.6% during the third cycle; in women, the corresponding rates were 26.6%, 33.5%, and 41.0%. In the overall cohort, responder rates did not differ between men and women during the first two cycles; during the third cycle, the distribution was different (P < 0.001) mostly because of higher rates of treatment stopping and non-responders in men. In the propensity score matched cohort, the trend was maintained but lost its statistical significance. Both men and women had a significant decrease in MHDs and in DAMs with BT-A treatment (P < 0.001). There were no gender differences in those changes with the only exception of MHD decrease which, during the third cycle, was lower in men than in women (7.4 vs 8.2 days, P = 0.016 in the overall cohort and 9.1 vs 12.5 days, P = 0.009 in the propensity score matched cohort). At the end of follow-up, 152 men and 485 women stopped BT-A treatment (29.1% vs 20.6%; P < 0.001). The relative proportion of patients stopping treatment because of inadequate response (less than 30% decrease in MHDs from baseline) was higher in men than in women (42.8% vs 39.6%), while the proportion of patients stopping because of adverse events was higher in women than in men (5.6% vs 0%; P = 0.031).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled analysis suggests that the response to BT-A is significant in both men and women with a small gender difference in favor of women. Men tended to stop the treatment more frequently than women. We emphasize the need for more gender-specific data on migraine treatments from randomized controlled trials and observational studies.\n",

Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to compare the pain-relieving effect of metoclopramide and ketorolac in acute primary headaches patients.\n",
      "METHODS: This double-blind, randomised clinical trial was conducted at Golestan Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran. This research involved all adult patients with acute primary (migraine or tension-type) headaches presented to the ED. Pain intensity was assessed with 0 to 10 verbal Numeric Rating Scales (NRS). The subjects were randomised into 10 mg intravenous (IV) metoclopramide or 30 mg IV ketorolac groups. Pain score and drug adverse reactions were compared between the two groups at baseline, 15, 30, and 60 min after baseline.\n",
      "RESULTS: 108 patients completed this trial and were equally divided into two groups (mean age of 34 ± 8.54 years; 57.4% female). Before treatment, the mean pain score was 6.9 and 6.8 in metoclopramide and ketorolac groups, respectively (p > 0.05). Metoclopramide failed to provide more improvement in pain score at 30 min (p = 0.55) and 60 min (p = 0.15) from baseline. There were no serious adverse events in this study. Only five patients required rescue medication which four of them were in ketorolac group.\n",

The patients were evaluated, before and after each treatment, using the following: the postural assessment software SAPO for the forward head posture; the CROM goniometer for the cervical range of motion; the Migraine Disability Assessment Score for headache parameters.\n",
      "RESULTS: After 3 months of each treatment, the scores obtained for the headache-related disability and the frequency of migraine decreased significantly for all groups, but the pain intensity scores changed significantly only in the onabolulinumtoxin-A (p = 0.01) and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups (p = 0.007). On the other hand, the forward head posture was reduced significantly in the physiotherapy (p = 0.002) and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups (p = 0.003). The cervical range of motion increased significantly in certain directions in the physiotherapy group and in the onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The physiotherapy improved the cervical parameters. The onabolulinumtoxin-A decreased pain intensity. As a consequence, it can be said that the combined treatment was more useful than a mono-therapy alone. From our results, it can be concluded that onabolulinumtoxin-A plus physiotherapy could be a good option in the management of chronic migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Combined withdrawal and early preventive medication was the most effective treatment for medication overuse headache (MOH) within the first 6 months in a previous study, but results from a longer follow-up period are lacking.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: (1) To measure the efficacy at 1 year of three different treatment approaches to MOH; (2) to compare withdrawal and early preventives (W+P), preventives with potential withdrawal therapy after 6 months (P+pW), and withdrawal with delayed potential preventives (W+pP); and (3) to identify predictors of chronic headache after 1 year.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with MOH and migraine and/or tension-type headache were randomly assigned to one of the three outpatient treatments. Headache calendar and questionnaires were filled out. Primary outcome was a reduction in headache days/month after 1 year.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 120 patients, 96 completed 1-year follow-up, and all were included in our analyses. Overall headache days/month were reduced from 24.6 (23.4-25.8) to 15.0 (13.0-17.0) (p < 0.0001), and only 11/96 patients (11%) relapsed. Reduction in monthly headache days was 10.3 days (95% CI: 6.7-13.9) in the W+P group, 10.8 days (95% CI: 7.6-14) in the P+pW group, and 7.9 days (95% CI: 5.1-10.7) in the W+pP group. No significant differences in treatment effect were seen between the three groups (p = 0.377). After 1 year, 39/96 (41%) had chronic headache. Predictors of chronic headache after 1 year were higher headache frequency (aOR 1.19; 1.09-1.31), more days with acute medication (aOR 1.11; 1.03-1.19), higher pain intensity (aOR 1.04; 1.01-1.08), and depression (aOR 4.7; 1.38-18.95), whereas higher self-rated health (aOR 0.61; 0.36-0.97) and high caffeine consumption (aOR 0.40; 0.16-0.96) were predictors of a lower risk of chronic headache. No adverse events were reported.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: All treatment strategies proved effective in treating MOH with a low relapse rate. The W+P strategy leads to the fastest effect, confirming earlier treatment recommendations. Identification of predictors for chronic headache may help identify more complex patients.\n",

      "METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on a total of 75 cardiac inpatients in three groups design (heat or cold therapy,and control group) as pre-test and post-test. Patients in the intervention group received heat or cold therapy for25 minutes, two times (at 1-hour interval), Patients in the control group did not receive any heat or cold therapy. Headache intensity was measured by the numeric rating scale for pain (NRS Pain), in three groups of study for 3 times (just before the study, at the end of applying the first therapy, and at the end of applying the second therapy).\n",
      "RESULTS: No baseline diﬀerences existed among the three groups for the mean pain scale score (P=0.781) just before the study; but the diﬀerence between three groups after applying heat and cold therapy was statistically significant (p=0.000).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated applying heat and cold therapy may reduce the intensity of nitrate induced migraine type headache in cardiac inpatients. Considering this fact that approximately 10% of patients cannot tolerate nitrate therapies due to unbearable headache, applying heat or cold therapy in patients with nitrate induced migraine type headache is recommended to improve patient's adherence to treatment.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most common symptoms after concussion, and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for chronic migraine (CM). However, there remains a paucity of data regarding the impact of mTBI on migraine-related symptoms and clinical course.\n",
      "METHODS: Of 2161 migraine patients who participated in the American Registry for Migraine Research between February 2016 and March 2020, 1098 completed questions assessing history of TBI (50.8%). Forty-four patients reported a history of moderate to severe TBI, 413 patients reported a history of mTBI. Patients' demographics, headache symptoms and triggers, history of physical abuse, allodynia symptoms (ASC-12), migraine disability (MIDAS), depression (PHQ-2), and anxiety (GAD-7) were compared between migraine groups with (n = 413) and without (n = 641) a history of mTBI. Either the chi-square-test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, was used for the analyses of categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used for the analyses of continuous variables. Logistic regression models were used to compare variables of interest while adjusting for age, gender, and CM.\n",
      "RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of patients with mTBI had CM (74.3% [307/413] vs. 65.8% [422/641], P = 0.004), had never been married or were divorced (36.6% [147/402] vs. 29.4% [187/636], P = 0.007), self-reported a history of physical abuse (24.3% [84/345] vs. 14.3% [70/491], P <  0.001), had mild to severe anxiety (50.5% [205/406] vs. 41.0% [258/630], P = 0.003), had headache-related vertigo (23.0% [95/413] vs. 15.9% [102/640], P = 0.009), and difficulty finding words (43.0% [174/405] vs. 32.9% [208/633], P <  0.001) in more than half their attacks, and headaches triggered by lack of sleep (39.4% [155/393] vs. 32.6% [198/607], P = 0.018) and reading (6.6% [26/393] vs. 3.0% [18/607], P = 0.016), compared to patients without mTBI. Patients with mTBI had significantly greater ASC-12 scores (median [interquartile range]; 5 [1-9] vs. 4 [1-7], P < 0.001), MIDAS scores (42 [18-85] vs. 34.5 [15-72], P = 0.034), and PHQ-2 scores (1 [0-2] vs. 1 [0-2], P = 0.012).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of mTBI are more likely to have a self-reported a history of physical abuse, vertigo, and allodynia during headache attacks, headaches triggered by lack of sleep and reading, greater headache burden and headache disability, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study suggests that a history of mTBI is associated with the phenotype, burden, clinical course, and associated comorbid diseases in patients with migraine, and highlights the importance of inquiring about a lifetime history of mTBI in patients being evaluated for migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Head-to-head comparator trials between first-line oral migraine preventatives and the new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have not been published to date.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to indirectly compare the clinical efficacy and safety of mAbs against CGRP or its receptor (CGRPR) and topiramate in episodic migraine prophylaxis using meta-analysis.\n",
      "METHODS: We included controlled trials testing efficacy and safety of erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and topiramate in adults diagnosed with episodic migraine. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2000 to November 2020. We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool to assess the risk of bias and report pooled mean effects (mean difference and risk ratio) as estimated in a random effect model. For efficacy analysis, we determined the reduction of monthly migraine days (MMDs), reduction of days with acute medication (AMDs), and 50% responder rates (50% RR). For safety, we determined adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥ 2% of study participants and the number of patients who discontinue treatment due to AEs (DAEs). The number needed to treat (NNT) and to harm (NNH) were estimated as well as the likelihood to help or harm (LLH).\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 13 trials involving 7557 patients: three trials with erenumab, two trials with galcanezumab, two trials with fremanezumab, one trial with eptinezumab, and five trials with topiramate, for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. The placebo-subtracted reduction (pooled mean difference) of MMDs were - 1.55 (95% CI - 1.86 to - 1.24; active drug n = 3326 vs placebo n = 2219, 8 studies) for the CGRP(R) mAb and - 1.11 (95% CI - 1.62 to - 0.59; active drug n = 1032 vs placebo n = 543, 4 studies) for topiramate (p for subgroup difference = 0.15). 'Cognitive' and 'sensory & pain'-related adverse events occurred more often in patients treated with topiramate compared with those treated with a CGRP(R) mAb (p for subgroup difference 0.03 and < 0.001, respectively). Based on the 50% RR and DAE, the NNT, NNH, and LHH for the CGRP(R) mAbs were 6, 130, and 24.3:1, respectively. For topiramate, these values were 7, 9, and 1.8:1, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The efficacy of CGRP(R) mAbs to reduce migraine days does not differ from topiramate. However, the safety profile is in favor of the CGRP(R) mAbs, with a higher likelihood to help than to harm compared with topiramate. The diversity of endpoint determination and the heterogeneity between studies for some endpoints cause some limitations for this study.\n",

      "METHODS: A case-control study involving 14 Saudi female migraineurs and 21 control subjects was conducted between December 2019 and March 2020. Demographic and disease history data were collected through participant interviews. Blood samples were drawn during the migraine attack and pain-free periods.\n",
      "RESULTS: Follicular (30.00±19.60; p&lt;0.001) and luteal (39.79±11.45; p=0.037) estrogen levels were significantly higher in patients with non-menstrual related migraine (NMM), while luteal testosterone levels (1.10±0.31; p=0.023) were significantly higher in patients with menstrually related migraine (MM). Body mass index (BMI) was higher in patients with NMM (25.77±6.53; p=0.013), and it was found to be associated with follicular estrogen (p=0.016), progesterone (p=0.018), and pain intensity (p=0.042). Luteal estrogen level was significantly lower (13.96±7.88; p=0.036) in patients with luteal onset of attack.\n",

This study verified the effect of Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix plus Semen Vaccariae in improving migraine-induced ED and explored its potential mechanism.\n",
      "METHODS: Key targets and signaling pathways of Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix plus Semen Vaccariae in migraine-induced erectile dysfunction treatment were predicted by network pharmacology. A rat model of migraine was established by nitroglycerin injection. Apomorphine was injected into rats to screen the migraine-induced erectile dysfunction model, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix-Semen Vaccariae granule suspension administered, and erectile function evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to compare the histological structure of the penile tissue, while RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to determine mRNA and protein levels, respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: Screening allowed us to identify common targets for migraine and ED; the signaling pathway exhibiting the greatest change was the Myosin light chain kinase- Calcium (MLCK-CaM) signal pathway. From Western blotting and RT-qPCR, we found that the levels of MLCK mRNA and protein in rats from Group B rats were significantly higher (P <0.05) than those in Groups A and C. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of CaM were significantly higher in Group B (P <0.05) than in Groups A and C.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Data indicate that the regulatory effects of Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix plus Semen Vaccariae on migraine-induced ED in a rat model are mediated by the MLCK-CaM signaling pathway.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) and spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) are now increasingly recognized. Both conditions predominantly affect females; however, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Large multi-center databases can help elucidate the underlying mechanism and optimize treatments to improve outcomes by allowing us to compare features and outcomes of patients with TTS and patients with SCAD.\n",
      "METHODS: Takotsubo syndrome patients were enrolled from the International Takotsubo Registry and compared to SCAD patients from the Canadian Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Cohort Study. In total 2098 TTS patients and 750 SCAD patients were included in the present study.\n",
      "RESULTS: More than 85% of patients in both groups were females. TTS patients were older compared to SCAD patients. Physical triggers were more common in TTS patients, while emotional triggers and non-identifiable triggering events were more common in SCAD patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction was more impaired in TTS compared to SCAD. TTS patients had more major cardiovascular risk factors, while SCAD patients had a higher rate of migraines and anxiety disorders than TTS patients. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in TTS patients, while 30-day stroke rates were comparable between groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that women are at higher risk for TTS and SCAD compared to men, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of those presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, emotional stressors play a significant role in triggering events particularly in younger women suffering from SCAD. The present findings may help clinicians better differentiate these two entities and aid in the appropriate risk stratification, diagnosis, and management.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine surgery has been shown to be efficacious, but nuanced effects of surgery on pain and individuals' lives remain incompletely understood. Surgery may be performed at a single or multiple \"primary\" sites. The aims of this study were to investigate patient perceptions following single-site surgery and compare themes in patients undergoing single-site surgery with those from a previously published conceptual framework generated with patients undergoing multisite surgery.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients who underwent single-site headache surgery participated in open-ended interviews at least 1 year after surgery. Participants (n = 14) had undergone either occipital, temporal, or nasoseptal site surgery. A multidisciplinary team analyzed transcripts. Recurring themes were identified and compared and contrasted to those observed in patients who underwent multiple-site surgery (n = 15) in a previous study (Plast Reconstr Surg 2019;144(4):956-964).\n",
      "RESULTS: Similar recurring themes emerged from the single-site cohort, and the conceptual framework was applicable to all participants. Two new themes emerged from the single-site analysis. First, 5 of 14 participants described being \"migraine-free\" postoperatively, a finding not observed in the multisite group. Second, several individuals described financial benefits after surgery, via decreased prescription medication requirements, raises at work, and improved productivity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Single-site headache surgery appears to positively impact patients' lives in ways that support and expand upon previously published outcomes. Patients undergoing surgery at a single site may be more likely to experience a \"pain-free\" state, which may relate to the underlying pathophysiology of chronic headache. The effect of surgery on finances appears to be an outcome of interest to patients, which should be explored further.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Balance dysfunction is a complex, disabling health condition that can present with multiple phenotypes and etiologies. Data regarding prevalence, characterization of dizziness, or associated factors is limited, especially in an African American population.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to characterize balance dysfunction presentation and prevalence in an African American cohort, and balance dysfunction relationship to cardiometabolic factors.\n",
      "RESEARCH DESIGN: The study design is descriptive, cross sectional analysis.\n",
      "STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample consist of N = 1,314, participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS).\n",
      "DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: JHS participants were presented an initial Hearing health screening questionnaire (N = 1,314). Of these, 317 participants reported dizziness and completed a follow-up Dizziness History Questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was used to compare differences in the cohorts' social-demographic characteristics and cardiometabolic variables to the 997 participants who did not report dizziness on the initial screening questionnaire. Based on questionnaire responses, participants were grouped into dizziness profiles (orthostatic, migraine, and vestibular) to further examine differences in cardiometabolic markers as related to different profiles of dizziness. Logistical regression models were adjusted for age, sex, education, reported noise exposure, and hearing sensitivity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Participants that reported any dizziness were slightly older and predominantly women. Other significant complaints in the dizzy versus nondizzy cohort included hearing loss, tinnitus, and a history of noise exposure (p &lt; 0.001). Participants that reported any dizziness had significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, blood pressure medication use, and higher body mass index (BMI). Individuals with symptoms alluding to an orthostatic or migraine etiology had significant differences in prevalence of hypertension, blood pressure medication use, and BMI (p &lt; 0.001). Alternatively, cardiometabolic variables were not significantly related to the report of dizziness symptoms consistent with vestibular profiles.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Dizziness among African Americans is comparable to the general population with regards to age and sex distribution, accordingly to previously published estimates. Participants with dizziness symptoms appear to have significant differences in BMI and blood pressure regulation, especially with associated orthostatic or migraine type profiles; this relationship does not appear to be conserved in participants who present with vestibular etiology symptoms.\n",

Rimegepant baseline characteristics were matched to the pooled subject characteristics from EVOLVE-I/II (galcanezumab vs. placebo; n = 1773) and STRIVE (ereumab vs. placebo; n = 955) by reweighting the rimegepant subjects to more closely match the distributions observed in these trials. To align with inclusion criteria of the mAb trials, only the subset of rimegepant subjects with a history of 4-14 MMDs were included (n = 257). Weighted mean differences were used to calculate adjusted change in MMDs, Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) score, and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2 (MSQv2) scores from baseline to week 12.\n",
      "RESULTS: When matched to the EVOLVE trials, rimegepant was superior to placebo with a mean difference in MMD change from baseline [95% confidence interval] of -1.16 [-1.80, -0.52] and was not statistically significantly different from galcanezumab 0.59 [-0.13, 1.32]. When matched to the STRIVE trial, rimegepant was superior to placebo -1.59 [-2.15, -1.03] and was not statistically significantly different from erenumab -0.06 [-0.61, 0.50]. Rimegepant showed superior MIDAS and MSQv2 results compared with placebo in both EVOLVE trials and in the STRIVE trial, no statistically significant differences from galcanezumab and erenumab regarding MIDAS, and favorable results compared with erenumab across all MSQv2 domains, while being generally similar to galcanezumab across all MSQv2 domains.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: When adjustments were made to reflect baseline characteristics in published literature, supporting data from BHV3000-201 suggest that rimegepant every other day is an effective therapy in reducing disability and MMDs and enhancing migraine-specific HRQoL. These data support the preventive benefit observed in randomized trials of rimegepant and further validate its efficacy for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common form of primary neurologic headache. Many patients are chronic migraineurs and suffer from a significant disability and adverse effects of drugs. There are various surgical options available to treat migraines, including peripheral neurectomies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To study the surgical and functional outcomes of migraine surgeries using peripheral neurectomies and compare them with conservatively treated patients.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Migraine patients who had a unilateral onset pain were given local bupivacaine block at the suspected trigger site, and those who were relieved were given the option for surgery. In the operative group, the peripheral nerve of the trigger site was lysed under local anesthesia. The conservative group was continued with the standard treatment. Evaluations with a baseline and 6 months visual analog score (VAS), migraine headache index (MHI), migraine disability assessment test (MIDAS), and pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ) scores were done.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 26 patients got benefitted with the local bupivacaine block, out of which 13 underwent surgery. At baseline, the VAS, MHI, MIDAS, and PSEQ scores were similar in both the groups. The operative group had significant (P < 0.001) improvement in all these parameters 6 months after the surgery. All patients of the operative group got free from prophylactic migraine treatment; however, 11 out of 13 patients still needed occasional  use of analgesics. There was one complication of transient temporal numbness.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Migraine surgery using peripheral neurectomies was more effective than chronic drug treatment in appropriately selected patients.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Over recent years, an increasing body of literature has focused on the relationship between erectile dysfunction (ED) and migraine. However, the specific mechanism is unclear.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a bioinformatic database to predict the targets and pathways associated with migraine and ED. Twenty male SD rats were randomly divided into a blank group (Group A, n = 10) and a migraine model group (Group B, n = 10). The rats in Group A were subcutaneously injected with normal saline (2 ml/kg) into the back of the neck. Rats in Group B were subcutaneously injected with nitroglycerin 10 mg/kg (5 mg/ml) into the back of the neck in order to create an animal model of migraine. Next, we carried out the measurement of erectile function. We used hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to compare the tissue structure of the cavernous body of the penis. Western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR in the protein; Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).\n",
      "RESULTS: There are 117 intersection targets of migraine and ED, involving 188 cell biological processes (BP), 21 cellular components (CC), 31 molecular functions (MF), and 65 signaling pathways. HE staining results show that there were no significant differences between Group A and Group B with regard to any of the parameters. Compared with Group A, the levels of the PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR proteins and PI3K, AKT, and mTOR mRNAs in Group B decreased (P &lt; 0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The decline of erectile function in a rat model of migraine was associated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether previously reported increasing incidence of pregnancy-associated stroke (PAS) is observed in chart-validated register data in Finland. In an exploratory analysis, we studied risk factors for PAS.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study and nested case-control study in Finland from 1987 to 2016. The Medical Birth Register (MBR) was linked to the Hospital Discharge Register to identify women with incident stroke (ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage) during pregnancy or puerperium. Cases were verified from patient records. Incidence of PAS over the study period in 5-year age groups and pregnancy/postpartum period was calculated per number of deliveries. Three matched controls were selected for each case from MBR to compare risk factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: After chart review, 29.6% (257 of 868) of cases were PAS. The incidence of PAS was 14.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.8-16.3) per 100,000 deliveries. Incidence increased from 11.1 to 25.2 per 100,000 deliveries from 1987 to 1991 to 2012 to 2016 (p &lt; 0.0001). Incidence increased by age from 9.8 to 29.9 per 100,000 deliveries from 20 to 24 years to &gt;40 years of age (p &lt; 0.0001). During the early postpartum period, incidence was 5-fold greater compared to the first trimester. Maternal mortality was 6.6%. In the multivariable-adjusted model, smoking beyond 12 gestational weeks (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), migraine (OR 16.3, 95% CI 5.3-49.8), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (OR 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.3) were the most important risk factors for PAS.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: PAS incidence is increasing, stressing the importance of careful pregnancy surveillance and risk factor management, particularly in older expectant mothers and extending to puerperium.\n",
      "CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that smoking beyond 12 gestational weeks, migraine, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of PAS.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of concurrent magnesium-sodium valproate therapy and compare it with either magnesium or sodium valproate alone in migraine prophylaxis.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized single-center double-blind parallel-group controlled clinical trial study was conducted on migraine patients within the age range of 18-65 years. The subjects with at least four monthly attacks were randomly assigned to group A (n = 82) sodium valproate, group B (n = 70) magnesium with sodium valproate, and group C (n = 70) magnesium. The patients passed a one-month baseline without prophylactic therapy and then received a 3-month treatment. The characteristics of migraine, including frequency, severity, duration of the attacks, and the number of painkillers taken per month, were monthly recorded in each visit. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) scores were recorded at the baseline and after 3 months of treatment in each group. Within- and between-group analyses were performed in this study.\n",
      "RESULTS: The obtained results revealed a significant reduction in all migraine characteristics in all groups compared to those reported for the baseline (P <  0.001). Intragroup data analysis indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in headache frequency between groups A and B in the third month (P = 0.525); nevertheless, three other parameters showed a significant reduction in group B, compared to those reported for group A in the third month (P <  0.05). On the other hand, group C could not effectively reduce measured parameters in the patients, compared to groups A and B after 3 months (P <  0.001). Furthermore, the MIDAS and HIT-6 scores significantly diminished in groups A, B, and C compared to those reported at the baseline (P <  0.001), and these changes were more significant in groups A and B than in group C (P <  0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The obtained results of this study revealed that magnesium could enhance the antimigraine properties of sodium valproate in combination therapy and reduce the required valproate dose for migraine prophylaxis.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Migraine has been associated with many comorbidities. However, lifestyle factors and the presence of comorbid diseases have not previously been extensively studied in the same sample. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle factors and comorbid diseases between patients with migraine and migraine-free controls with subgroup analyses to determine the pathophysiology and possible consequences.\n",
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 1257 patients with migraine between the ages of 20 and 65 years from a headache outpatient clinic in Taiwan and 496 non-migraine controls. All participants completed questionnaires regarding demographics, migraine diagnosis, sleep, headache burden, and medical, pain, and psychiatric conditions. Participants also underwent a structured interview. The associations between comorbidities and migraine were investigated and further stratified by sex and aura.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with migraine with aura had an unhealthier lifestyle compared with controls in the form of current smoking status (15.5% [67/431] vs. 11.5% [57/496], p = 0.013). Furthermore, medical- (e.g., thyroid disease; 7.2% [91/1257 vs. 2.8% [14/496]; p = 0.006), psychiatric- (e.g., depression; 6% [76/1257 vs. 2.6% [13/496]; p = 0.031), and pain-related (e.g., fibromyalgia; 8% [101/1257 vs. 3.2% [16/496]; p = 0.006) comorbidities were more prevalent in patients compared with controls. Subgroup analyses revealed that chronic migraine, migraine with aura, and female sex were associated with a greater number of significant comorbidities than episodic migraine, migraine without aura, and male patients with migraine, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Individuals seeking treatment for migraine reported greater levels of smoking and medical, psychiatric, and pain conditions than non-treatment-seeking healthy controls who were recruited from the community. Understanding the relationship between migraine and comorbid diseases may improve medical care as well as the quality of life.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Carnitine plays a significant role in fatty acid transportation in mitochondria and has been shown to have a prophylactic effect on adult migraine. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare and evaluate the effects of L-carnitine supplementation versus propranolol in the prevention of pediatric migraine.\n",
      "MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 60 pediatric patients with episodic migraine were randomly allocated to 2 independent groups to receive either 50 mg/kg/day L-carnitine or 1 mg/kg/day propranolol as a prophylactic drug. Frequency, severity, and duration of migraine attacks and headache disability based on the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS) were studied at the baseline and after 2, 4, and 12 weeks.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were evaluated in the study: 23 girls (41%) and 33 boys (59%) with a mean age of 9.7 ± 2.1 years. Frequency of migraine headaches per month reduced from 11.4 ± 7.1 to 5.34 ± 2.4 in the L-carnitine group and from 10.7 ± 6.2 to 4.96 ± 3.9 in the propranolol group by the end of the study. Headache severity score was also reduced from 19.38 ± 14 to 2.88 ± 7.4 and from 12.92 ± 13 to 0.82 ± 1.3 in the L-carnitine and propranolol groups, respectively. We found a significant decrease in frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks in both groups (P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was observed between the efficacies of the 2 drugs.This study concluded that L-carnitine supplementation can play a prophylactic role in the management of pediatric migraine.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of lasmiditan (LTN) in treating migraine attacks of mild vs. moderate or severe pain intensity.\n",
      "METHODS: Pooled data from two single-attack, placebo-controlled studies (SAMURAI [NCT02439320] and SPARTAN [NCT02605174]), and a prospective, randomized, open-label study (GLADIATOR [NCT02565186]) were assessed. Efficacy measures included the proportion of attacks with 2-h pain freedom (PF), 2-h most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom, and 24-h sustained pain freedom (SPF). Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of PF, SPF, or MBS freedom outcomes among attacks treated at mild, moderate, or severe pain.\n",
      "RESULTS: In SAMURAI and SPARTAN, most treated attacks were of moderate (N = 2768) or severe (N = 1147) intensity, compared to mild (N = 65). Numerically greater 2-h PF and 24-h SPF response rates were observed in attacks treated at mild compared to moderate or severe pain. Analysis of GLADIATOR data included 273 (1.5%), 11,644 (65.1%), and 5948 (33.3%) attacks treated when pain was mild, moderate, and severe, respectively. In general, a significantly greater proportion of attacks treated at mild pain achieved 2-h PF and MBS freedom, as well as 24-h SPF. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in LTN treatment groups were similar regardless of baseline head pain intensity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Data from two placebo-controlled, single-attack trials, and an open-label study including treatment of multiple attacks, suggested a tendency to relatively better efficacy outcomes when LTN treatment was initiated at mild vs. moderate to severe pain. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship of lasmiditan outcomes to the time of administration in the course of a migraine attack.\n",

However, studies comparing lamotrigine to other, first-line prophylactic agents solely involving patients suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.\n",
      "METHODS: Fifty-three patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine or topiramate for at least 6 months were included. Pre- and post-treatment clinical data regarding monthly aura frequency and duration, monthly migraine frequency, days of headache and rescue medication used per month were collected.\n",
      "RESULTS: Responder rates were similar between the two treatment groups at 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%). Moreover, 50% of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of migraine aura compared with 37% of topiramate-treated patients. Side effects were more frequent in topiramate group compared with lamotrigine group (p=0.004).\n",

      "RESULTS: UCPPS participants with HL were older, had increased nocturia, higher Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Indexes, and were more likely to report \"painful urgency\" compared with those without HL. On the other hand, UCPPS without HL reported more intense nonurologic pain, greater distribution of pain outside the pelvis, greater numbers of comorbid chronic overlapping pain conditions, higher fibromyalgia-like symptoms, and greater pain centralization, and were more likely to have migraine headache than those with HL. UCPPS without HL also had higher anxiety, perceived stress, and pain catastrophizing than those with HL. There were no differences in sex distribution, UCPPS symptom duration, intensity of urologic pain, distribution of genital pain, pelvic floor tenderness on pelvic examination, quality of life, depression, pain characteristics (nociceptive pain vs. neuropathic pain), mechanical hypersensitivity in the suprapubic area during quantitative sensory testing, and 3-year longitudinal pain outcome and urinary outcome between the two groups.\n",

Nowadays, a large number of randomized controlled clinical studies have shown that Chinese patent medicine has the advantages of good curative effect and high safety in the treatment of migraine. However, due to the variety of proprietary Chinese medicines, their relative effectiveness and safety have not yet been verified. Therefore, this study will use the network meta-analysis method to verify the effectiveness and safety of different kinds of Chinese patent medicines in the treatment of migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: All randomized controlled trials of Toutongning capsule, Yangxue Qingnao granule, naoxintong capsules, Tianmagouteng granules in the treatment of migraine were searched from PubMed, Cochrane Library, web of science, EMBASE, sinomed, CNKI, Wanfang database, VIP. The retrieval time is from the establishment of the database to November 18, 2020. In order to avoid omission, we will manually retrieve relevant references and conference papers. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we evaluated the quality and risk of all the retrieved literatures. Methodological quality assessment and bias risk will be assessed using the Cochrane bias risk tool. Revman 5.3, WinBUGS 1.4.3, and stata14.2 software will be used for all data analysis.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: There is interest in whether supplements, including vitamin D and marine omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, may be effective migraine prophylaxis. However, few studies have evaluated whether vitamin D or n-3 fatty acid supplementation may reduce migraine frequency or severity.\n",
      "METHODS: Participants in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) were assigned to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (2000 IU/d) or marine n-3 fatty acid (1 g/d) supplementation in a 2-by-2 factorial design. Lifetime history of migraine was assessed a median of 4.6 years after the start of the trial. Individuals were asked to self-report changes in migraine frequency (no change, more frequent, or less frequent) and severity (no change, more severe, less severe) in the past 5 years. We used χ2 tests to compare proportions of individuals reporting changes in migraine frequency and severity between active and placebo groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 25,871 participants in VITAL, 1032 participants had a history of probable migraine and provided information on changes in migraine frequency and severity. The percentage of individuals reporting decreases in migraine frequency did not differ between active (69.0%) and placebo vitamin D (68.4%) (P value = 0.54) or between active (67.8%) and placebo n-3 fatty acid (69.6%) (P value = 0.82). Similarly, the percentage of individuals reporting decreases in migraine severity did not differ between active (64.1%) and placebo vitamin D (65.0%) (P value = 0.86) or between active (64.5%) and placebo n-3 fatty acid (64.5%) (P value = 0.96).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Neither vitamin D nor marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation, compared to placebo, affected migraine frequency or severity among middle-aged or older adults.\n",

      "BACKGROUND /AIM: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of greater occipital nerve (GON) block alone and GON combined with supraorbital nerve (SON) block in the treatment of medication overuse headache (MOH).\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: 82 patients were divided into two groups: 41 patients were administered bilateral GON block while the other 41 patients GON + SON block. Nerve blocks were administered every 10 days for a total of 5 sessions. After each administration and 20 days after the last injection, information on pre and post treatment numerical rating scale (NRS) score, number of painful days, analgesic intake, duration of pain were collected.\n",
      "RESULTS: The decrease in headache evaluation parameters was similar in both groups after the block. The NRS scores in the GON and GON + SON groups before the treatment was (8.2 ± 0.7, 8.5 ± 0.7), the number of painful days in a month was (21.4 ± 6.9, 21.2 ± 4.6 days), the number of analgesics taken monthly was (45 ± 25.6, 47.5 ± 29.9), the duration of pain was (44.9 ± 24.6, 41.7 ± 22.8 h), respectively. On the 60th day of treatment, the NRS scores in the GON and GON + SON groups were found to be (6.8 ± 2.5, 4.8 ± 2.3), the number of painful days in a month was (4.2 ± 3.3, 2.2 ± 1.5), respectively. The number of monthly analgesic consumption was (4.4 ± 3.8, 0.9 ± 1.2), and the duration of pain was (28.4 ± 19.3, 19.4 ± 16.1 h).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study showed significant reductions in headache parameters in both groups. However, NRS score, analgesic intake, number of painful days, and pain duration significantly better improved in the GON block added SON block group.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Conduct disorder (CD), a serious behavioral and emotional disorder in childhood and adolescence, characterized by disruptive behavior and breaking societal rules. Studies have explored the overlap of CD with neurodevelopmental problems (NDP). The somatic health of children with NDP has been investigated; however, the prevalence of these problems in children with CD has not been sufficiently studied. Holistic assessment of children with CD is required for establishing effective treatment strategies.\n",
      "AIMS: (1) Define the prevalence of selected neurological problems (migraine and epilepsy) and gastrointestinal problems (celiac disease, lactose intolerance, diarrhea, and constipation) in a population of twins aged 9 or 12; (2) Compare the prevalence of somatic problems in three subpopulations: (a) children without CD or NDP, (b) children with CD, and (c) children with both CD and NDP; (3) Select twin pairs where at least one child screened positive for CD but not NDP (proband) and map both children's neurological and gastrointestinal problems.\n",
      "METHOD: Telephone interviews with parents of 20,302 twins in a cross-sectional, nationwide, ongoing study. According to their scores on the Autism-Tics, AD/HD, and Comorbidities inventory, screen-positive children were selected and divided into two groups: (1) children with CD Only, (2) children with CD and at least one NDP.\n",
      "RESULTS: Children with CD had an increased prevalence of each neurological and gastrointestinal problem (except celiac disease), and the prevalence of somatic problems was further increased among children with comorbid CD and NDP. The presence of CD (without NDP) increased the odds of constipation for girls and the odds of epilepsy for boys. Girls with CD generally had more coexisting gastrointestinal problems than boys with CD. Female co-twins of probands with CD were strongly affected by gastrointestinal problems. Concordance analyses suggested genetic background factors in neurological and gastrointestinal problems, but no common etiology with CD could be concluded.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Co-occurring NDP could explain most of the increased prevalence of somatic problems in CD. Our results raise a new perspective on CD in children and adolescents; their CD seems to be linked to a number of other health problems, ranging from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders to somatic complaints.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine pathogenesis still remains uncertain. Studies have found contradictory results regarding NO, S100B and NSE parameters in migraine patients. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to measure NO, S100B and NSE concentrations in migraine patients, compare them with the control group and find the relationship between these parameters.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (35 women and 17 men) diagnosed with migraine according to the International Headache Classification II criteria were included in the study. 30 healthy participants without any history of disease were included in the control group. Serum NO, S100B and NSE levels were determined in all participants.\n",
      "RESULTS: It was found that NO, S100B parameters increased compared to the control group, and NSE parameter decreased compared to the control group in the migraine patients participating in this study (p = 0,004, p = 0,002, p = 0,000) It was found that there was a moderate positive linear correlation between serum S100B and NSE in the migraine patients in our study (r = 442, p = 0.011).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In our study, the fact that there was a statistically significant difference in the NO, S100b and NSE parameters of migraine and control group patients indicates that these molecules can be effective in the pathogenesisof migraine. The moderate positive linear correlation found between serum S100B and NSE in migraine patients in our study demonstrates that these molecules together can be effective in the pathogenesis.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to describe the clinical manifestations of functional motor disorders (FMDs) coexisting with other neurological diseases (\"comorbid FMDs\"), and to compare comorbid FMDs with FMDs not overlapping with other neurological diseases (\"pure FMDs\").\n",
      "METHODS: For this multicenter observational study, we enrolled outpatients with a definite FMD diagnosis attending 25 tertiary movement disorder centers in Italy. Each patient with FMDs underwent a detailed clinical assessment including screening for other associated neurological conditions. Group comparisons (comorbid FMDs vs. pure FMDs) were performed in order to compare demographic and clinical variables. Logistic regression models were created to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of comorbid FMDs (dependent variable) in relation to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (independent variables).\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of 410 FMDs, 21.7% of patients (n = 89) had comorbid FMDs. The most frequent coexisting neurological diseases were migraine, cerebrovascular disease and parkinsonism. In the majority of cases (86.5%), FMDs appeared after the diagnosis of a neurological disease. Patients with comorbid FMDs were older, and more frequently had tremor, non-neurological comorbidities, paroxysmal non-epileptic seizures, major depressive disorders, and benzodiazepine intake. Multivariate regression analysis showed that diagnosis of comorbid FMDs was more likely associated with longer time lag until the final diagnosis of FMD, presence of tremor and non-neurological comorbidities.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for prompt diagnosis of FMDs, given the relatively high frequency of associated neurological and non-neurological diseases.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare spatial pain modulation capabilities between adolescents with and without migraine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses at the leg are similar in adolescents with versus without migraine. However, the anatomical region of testing may affect spatial pain modulation capabilities as differences in nociceptive processing between patients with migraine and healthy controls are found in local areas that are near the site of clinical pain but not in nonlocal areas. This study aimed to examine spatial pain modulation capabilities tested by the CPM paradigm using test stimulus applied to a local body area.\n",
      "METHODS: Nineteen adolescents with migraine (age 14.9 ± 2.3, mean ± SD; 16 female) and 20 healthy adolescents (age 13.8 ± 2.5, mean ± SD; 16 female) completed this case-control study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed at the trapezius before and during immersion of the foot in a cold water bath (8°C).\n",
      "RESULTS: In the migraine group (146.0 ± 79.1, mean ± SD), compared to healthy controls (248.0 ± 145.5, mean ± SD), significantly lower PPT (kilopascal) values were found (estimate = 124.28, 95% CI: 58.98, 189.59, p < 0.001; effect size: d = 1.40). No differences between the groups were found for pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings of cold-water immersion nor the CPM response.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study found altered ascending nociceptive processing of mechanical stimuli at the neck in adolescents with migraine. However, endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms were functional and not altered. In light of other studies, impairments in inhibitory control may not be involved in migraine pathophysiology in pediatric patients regardless of stimulus location.\n",

      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.\n",
      "SETTING: Data from the population-based online self-administered Japan National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) 2017.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to the NHWS (n=30 001) were ≥18 years. Migraine patients were respondents with self-reported experience and physician diagnosis of migraine. Non-migraine controls reported no migraine experience. Migraine patients were subgrouped into currently taking prescription medication for migraine (Rx) and currently not taking prescription medication (non-Rx).\n",
      "METHODS: One-way analysis of variance tests were performed to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity and activity impairment and healthcare resource utilisation between migraine patients and matched non-migraine controls selected by 1:1 propensity score matching. Generalised linear models were used to compare outcomes and migraine related characteristics between Rx and non-Rx.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with matched controls, migraine patients (n=1265) had significantly lower HRQoL in terms of lower Physical Component Summary (48.36 vs 51.29, p<0.001), Mental Component Summary (44.65 vs 48.31, p<0.001), Role/Social Component Summary (41.78 vs 46.18, p<0.001) and mean EuroQol 5-Dimension index (0.77 vs 0.86, p<0.001) scores. Migraine patients experienced significantly higher absenteeism (6.95% vs 3.07%, p<0.001), presenteeism (32.73% vs 18.94%, p<0.001), work productivity loss (34.82% vs 20.03%, p<0.001) and daily activity impairment (35.70% vs 22.04%, p<0.001) and visited healthcare professionals more often (8.38 vs 4.57, p<0.001) than controls. No significant differences in these outcomes were found when comparing Rx (n=587) and non-Rx (n=678) patients.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Neuroleptics are commonly prescribed drugs to treat acute conditions (e.g., migraines) in the emergency department, but can cause serious adverse effects. Using diphenhydramine to prevent these adverse effects is very common but remains controversial.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to determine whether prophylactic administration of diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of neuroleptic adverse effects in patients with acute conditions.\n",
      "METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating any neuroleptic with diphenhydramine vs. the same neuroleptic with any inactive agent. Primary outcome was incidence of any extrapyramidal adverse effect. Secondary outcomes were akathisia, rescue medication, subjective restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and sedation. Independent reviewers scanned identified citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect models.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 1566 identified citations, nine studies (n = 1648 patients) met eligibility criteria. Four studies were specifically designed to compare the incidence of neuroleptic adverse effects with and without co-administration of diphenhydramine. Four studies were at high risk of bias. In primary analysis, diphenhydramine had no effect on the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (7 studies, n = 1393, risk ratio [RR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-1.31) or akathisia (5 studies, n = 1094; RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.33-1.82) or any of the secondary outcomes. In subgroup analysis, diphenhydramine was associated with a significant decrease in extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (4 studies, n = 705; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.90). Dosage analysis yielded no further information.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: When compared with placebo, diphenhydramine was associated with a significant reduction of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Overall quality of evidence is low. Further studies are warranted.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of galcanezumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with and without comorbid anxiety and/or depression.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Patients with migraine have a higher risk of anxiety and/or depression. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and their potential negative prognostic impact, determining the efficacy of migraine treatments in patients with these comorbidities is important.\n",
      "METHODS: The results of 2 phase 3 episodic migraine studies of patients with 4-14 migraine headache days (MHD) per month were pooled. A third chronic migraine study, which was evaluated separately, enrolled patients with ≥15 headache days per month, of which ≥8 had migraine-like features. Patients in all 3 studies were randomized 2:1:1 to placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg, or galcanezumab 240 mg. The efficacy of galcanezumab on migraine was measured in subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (current or past) and patients without. A repeated measures model was used to compare treatment groups within each subgroup and to test for consistency of treatment effect across the anxiety/depression subgroups (subgroup-by-treatment interaction) during the double-blind treatment phases.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 1773 intent-to-treat patients with episodic migraine, both doses of galcanezumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements relative to placebo in overall number of MHD for the subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -2.07 [-2.81, -1.33] for galcanezumab 120 mg [P < .001], -1.91 [-2.78, -1.04] for 240 mg [P < .001]) and without anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -1.92 [-2.36, -1.47] for 120 mg [P < .001], -1.77 [-2.20, -1.33] for 240 mg [P < .001]), as was observed for the secondary outcomes of MHD with acute medication use and functional impairment. Among 1113 intent-to-treat patients with chronic migraine, those with anxiety and/or depression had significant reductions in overall MHD frequency with the 240-mg dose (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -1.92 [-3.52, -0.33]; P = .018), whereas significant reductions were observed at both the 120-mg (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -2.29 [-3.26, -1.31]; P < .001) and 240-mg (-1.85 [-2.83, -0.87]; P < .001) doses in patients without anxiety and/or depressions. Significant reductions (P < .01) in MHD with acute medication use were observed at both doses within both anxiety/depression subgroups and for overall functional impairment for patients without anxiety and/or depression, though neither dose significantly reduced overall functional impairment beyond placebo in the subgroup with anxiety and/or depression. In the episodic and chronic migraine studies, the subgroup-by-treatment interaction was not statistically significant for MHD, MHD with acute medication use, or functional impairment (chronic study only), suggesting a lack of evidence of differential effect between subgroups. Furthermore, differences between subgroups in the mean change differences from placebo, as well as overlapping 95% confidence intervals for the subgroups, indicated lack of a clinical or statistical difference between subgroups for these outcome variables. There was a significantly higher percentage of patients with episodic migraine attaining ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions, and a higher percentage of patients with chronic migraine attaining ≥50% and ≥75% reductions from baseline with galcanezumab compared with placebo, regardless of medical history of anxiety and/or depression.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A medical history of anxiety and/or depression does not seem to interfere with response to galcanezumab among patients with episodic migraine, and both doses of galcanezumab appear efficacious for these individuals regardless of this psychiatric history. Among patients with chronic migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression, the 240-mg dose, but not the 120-mg dose, significantly decreased overall MHD, but neither dose resulted in significantly greater functional improvement. Patients with migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression often require additional interventions, and this may be more important in chronic migraine.\n",

Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 and psychological distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall, pain was most frequently reported in the frontal and temporal regions in patients with either episodic or chronic migraine, whereas pain was most frequent in the suboccipital region in patients with cervicogenic headache. A larger pain extent was moderately correlated with higher headache intensity (rs = 0.53, P = 0.003) and poorer quality of life (rs ranged from -0.36 to -0.40, P < 0.05) in patients with chronic migraine, whereas pain extent was associated with longer headache duration in those with cervicogenic headache (rs = 0.35, P = 0.04).

      "BACKGROUND: Primary headache syndrome (PHS) patients frequently present to otolaryngologists with sinonasal complaints and diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) due to symptomatic overlap. In this study, we compare demographic, subjective, and objective clinical findings of patients with PHS versus CRS.\n",
      "METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of patients presenting to a single tertiary care Rhinology clinic from December 2011-July 2017. Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT) scores and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores were obtained. Lund-MacKay CT scores were calculated, if available. Requirement of headache specialist management was compared between PHS and CRS groups. Patients with both CRS and PHS (CRScPHS) that required headache specialist management were compared to patients with CRS without PHS (CRSsPHS) and patients with PHS alone using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to determine significant diagnostic thresholds.\n",
      "RESULTS: One-hundred four PHS patients and 130 CRS patients were included. PHS patients (72.1%) were more likely than CRS patients to require headache specialist management (6.9%, p&lt;0.0001). CRSsPHS patients had significantly higher Nasal domain scores compared to PHS patients (p = 0.042) but not compared to CRScPHS patients (p&gt;0.99). CRScPHS (p = 0.0003) and PHS (p&lt;0.0001) subgroups of patients had significantly higher Aural/Facial domain scores compared to CRSsPHS patients. PHS patients also had significantly higher Sleep domains scores compared to CRSsPHS patients (p&lt;0.0001). Both CRScPHS and CRSsPHS subgroups had significantly higher nasal endoscopy scores (p&lt;0.0001) and CT scores (p = 0.04 &amp; p&lt;0.0001, respectively) compared to the PHS group. Aural/Facial domain score of 4, nasal endoscopy score of 4, and CT score of 2 were found to be reliable diagnostic thresholds for absence of CRS.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The SNOT-22 may be used to distinguish PHS from CRS based upon the Aural/Facial and Sleep domains. Patients with CRS have more severe Nasal domain scores and worse objective endoscopy and CT findings.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the serum levels of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components between patients with migraine and healthy controls, and to evaluate whether these levels are associated with migraine severity. We hypothesized that migraine would be associated with the activation of the inflammatory arm of the RAS, possibly leading to increased levels of angiotensin (Ang) II.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have proposed the use of drugs that interfere with RAS, a hormonal system primarily implicated in blood pressure regulation, as a prophylactic strategy for migraine. However, no previous studies have directly assessed RAS components in migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 30 patients with episodic migraine who were in the interictal period and 20 healthy controls. This study was conducted at Hospital das Clínicas (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) outpatient clinic. Headache severity was evaluated using the Headache Impact Test, version 6 (HIT-6) and the Migraine Disability Test (MIDAS) questionnaires. Given that migraine is comorbid with mood disorders, depressive and anxious symptoms were evaluated using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories (BDI and BAI), respectively. Clinical and demographic data were also collected. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Ang II, and Ang (1-7) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with migraine and controls were comparable in age, body mass index, blood pressure, and depressive and anxious symptoms. Patients with migraine showed lower levels of ACE [85.2 (66.8, 101.2) vs 65.5 (54.2, 77.5); P = .005] and lower ACE/ACE2 ratio [4.3 (3.4, 5.2) vs 3.5 (2.9, 4.1); P = .032] than controls. Conversely, patients with migraine had higher levels of Ang II [309.7 ± 147.4 vs 605.4 ± 200.4; difference: -287.1 (95% CI: -391.4--182.8), P < .001] and Ang (1-7) [214.4 ± 155.8 vs 397.9 ± 217.9; difference: -184.6 (95% CI: -296.7--72.6), P = .001] than controls. There were no correlations between RAS serum markers and migraine severity scores (HIT and MIDAS) or depressive and anxious symptoms (BDI and BAI) (P > .05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results suggest the participation of RAS in migraine pathophysiology, but not in its severity.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To calculate the change in prevalence of comorbidities between symptom onset and the time of study, to compare the prevalences of comorbidities with those in the Australian population at the time of study and to examine onset-type differences.\n",
      "METHODS: Comorbidity data from 1518 participants of the Australian MS Longitudinal Study and Australian population comparator data (2014-2015 National Health Survey) were used. The change in prevalence between time points and prevalence ratios (PR) at the time of study (crude, age and sex adjusted, and stratified by onset type) was calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Comorbidities were common, and those with the largest increases in prevalence between MS symptom onset and the time of study were depression (+ 26.9%), anxiety (+ 23.1%), hypertension (+ 21.9%), elevated cholesterol (+ 16.3%), osteoarthritis (+ 17.1%), eye diseases (+ 11.6%), osteoporosis (+ 10.9%) and cancer (+ 10.3%). Compared to the general population and after age and sex adjustment, participants had a significantly higher prevalence for 14/19 comorbidities at the time of study. The associations were strongest for anaemia, cancer (both PR > 4.00), anxiety, depression, migraine (all PR > 3.00), psoriasis and epilepsy (both PR > 2.00). No significant differences were seen by onset type.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Comorbidities are common at MS symptom onset and increase with MS duration. Having MS may thus contribute to accrual of comorbidities. This emphasises the importance of optimal screening for and management of comorbidities in early MS and throughout the disease course.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disease, which seriously affects the quality of life and daily activities of patients. Although migraine is a transient phenomenon of cerebral vasoconstriction, it is well documented that recurrent attacks of migraine may lead to abnormalities in retinal structure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a sensitive method to detect subtle damage in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). There have been many studies investigating the difference in RNFL thickness with optical coherence tomography (OCT) between migraine patients and healthy controls. However, the results were not consistent. Our purpose is to perform a meta-analysis to investigate RNFL alterations in migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: We will search PubMed, Embase, Web of science for studies assessing the differences in RNFL measured by OCT between patients with migraine and healthy controls. Case-control studies published in English will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen eligible articles, extract data, and assess quality. This meta-analysis will synthesize selected research data and compare the difference in RNFL thickness between patients with migraine and healthy controls. We will use Stata 15 in this meta-analysis. I statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity. If I ≤ 50%, the data are synthesized will use a fixed effect model. Otherwise, a random effect model will be performed. Publication bias will be determined by the Egger test. The methodological quality of all included studies will be evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). We will perform subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis to test the robustness of the results.\n",
      "RESULTS: We will obtain quantitative results regarding the difference in RNFL thickness between migraine patients and healthy controls. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a high-quality synthesis of existing evidence and provide a basis for assessing the effect of migraine on the thickness of RNFL.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: To compare medication use and health resource utilization between migraineurs with evidence of opioid use at emergency department visit versus no opioid use at emergency department visit, and to examine predictors of opioid use among migraineurs at emergency department visits.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective study using REACHnet electronic health records (December 2013 to April 2017) from Baylor Scott & White Health Plan. The index date was defined as the first migraine-related emergency department visit after ≥6 months of enrollment. Adult patients with a migraine diagnosis and ≥6 months of continuous enrollment before and after their index dates were included. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to compare medication use and health resource utilization between opioid users and non-opioid users. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine predictors of opioid use at emergency department visits.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 788 migraineurs met eligibility criteria. Over one-third (n = 283, 35.9%) received ≥1 opioid medication during their index date emergency department visit. Morphine (n = 103, 13.1%) and hydromorphone (n = 85, 10.8%) were the most frequently used opioids. Opioid users had more hospitalizations and emergency department visits during their pre-index period (both p &lt; 0.05). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) predictors of opioid use at emergency department visits included past migraine-related opioid use (2-4 prescriptions, Odds Ratio = 1.66; 5-9 prescriptions, Odds Ratio = 2.12; ≥10 prescriptions, Odds Ratio = 4.43), past non-migraine-related opioid use (≥10 prescriptions, Odds Ratio = 1.93), past emergency department visits (1-3 visits, Odds Ratio = 1.84), age (45-64 years, Odds Ratio = 1.45), and sleep disorder (Odds Ratio = 1.43), controlling for covariates.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Opioids were commonly given to migraineurs at emergency departments. Previous opioid use, health resource utilization, age, and specific comorbidities might be used to identify migraineurs with a high risk of opioid use.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare psychological difficulties in patients with migraine and those with epilepsy by using the PARADISE-24 questionnaire.\n",
      "METHODS: Overall, 240 migraineurs and 210 patients with epilepsy were enrolled. All the participants were asked to fill the Persian version of the PARADISE-24 questionnaire.\n",
      "RESULTS: In migraineurs, the mean age and mean headache severity (by means of visual analogue scale, VAS) were 38.6±11.6 and 6.8±2.8, respectively. In patients with epilepsy, the mean age and mean duration of the disease were 33.6±13.4 and 12±10.3 years, respectively.

      "BACKGROUND: PA has been implicated in the development, manifestation, and treatment of various headache disorders. However, objective quantification of PA across headache types is lacking, and no study has quantified both prospective PA and the influence of headache occurrence on PA.\n",
      "METHODS: A prospective cohort study followed university participants with migraine, with TTH, or without headache for 7 days using an Omron HJ-112 pedometer and daily headache diaries. Daily free-living PA was compared between groups, and differences in PA as a function of headache day vs non-headache day were compared among those with migraine and TTH.\n",
      "RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 516 observations from 100 young adults (81/100 female, mean age = 19.0 ± 1.7) comprised of 28 individuals with migraine, 37 individuals with TTH, and 35 non-headache controls. On average, individuals with migraine engaged in less total PA than non-headache controls (6847 vs 8573 steps/day; mean difference = -1726 [95% CI: -3135 to -318], P = .017) across the 7-day monitoring period. After adjusting for relevant covariates (psychological symptoms, body mass index, weekend vs weekday), this difference was evident on both non-headache days (adjusted mean = 5987 vs 8610, P = .002) and headache days (adjusted mean = 6986 vs 9958, P = .017). In contrast, PA of individuals with TTH (mean = 7691 steps/day) did not significantly differ from those with migraine. PA within groups as a function of headache day (vs non-headache day) did not significantly differ for individuals with migraine (mean = 7357 vs 6191, P = .061) or individuals with TTH (mean = 7814 vs 7641, P = .736).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other studies, individuals with migraine reported lower levels of PA compared to non-headache controls. Notably, relative reductions in PA occurred even on days in which headache was not experienced and were not attributable to the examined covariates, instead supporting a more global pattern of reduced PA. Further research is needed to isolate the mechanisms underlying interictal reductions in PA among those with migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing trigger-site deactivation surgery for headaches report a high prevalence (approximately 37 percent) of prior head or neck injury. Traditional medical treatment often fails to treat these posttraumatic patients. It is unclear whether surgery mirrors these poor outcomes. This study aims to describe the characteristics of posttraumatic headache surgery patients and compare their postoperative results to those of patients without a history of head or neck injury.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred forty-two patients undergoing trigger-site deactivation surgery were prospectively enrolled. Patients were requested to complete a preoperative questionnaire on headache history, including the Migraine Headache Index and information on prior head or neck injury. Follow-up surveys were requested at approximately 12 months postoperatively.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seventy patients (49 percent) reported a history of head or neck injury, and 41 (29 percent) classified the injury as the precipitating event leading to their headache onset. Patients with a precipitating event were significantly less likely to report a family history of migraine. There was no significant difference in mean preoperative Migraine Headache Index between cohorts. At 12 months postoperatively, there was no significant difference in Migraine Headache Index reduction between groups. The proportion of patients who experienced at least a 50 and 80 percent improvement in Migraine Headache Index per group, respectively, was 83 and 67 percent (atraumatic), 76 and 68 percent (posttraumatic), and 71 and 63 percent (precipitating event).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that surgical outcomes in posttraumatic headache patients are comparable to those without injury. Trigger-site deactivation surgery candidates with a history of injury can therefore expect similar outcomes as reported for patients overall.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Abdominal migraine (AM) is uncommon and understudied. Our objective was to investigate the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with AM and compare with that of pediatric gastroenterologists and neurologists.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHOD: All AM cases (1-18 years) from a USA hospital with diagnosis of abdominal migraine or its variants (ICD-9 346.2 or IC-10 G43.D, G43.D0, G43.D1) between 2011 and 2017 were reviewed. Information on diagnosis, interval from onset of symptoms, diagnostic criteria, diagnostic tests, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: 69 medical records were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.7 years, and 48% of patients were female. 50/69 (72.4%) patients were exclusively treated by a pediatric gastroenterologist and 10/69 (14.5%) exclusively by a pediatric neurologist. 6/69 (8.7%) were initially evaluated by gas troenterology and referred to neurology, and 2/69 (2.9%) were initially evaluated by neurology and then referred to gastroenterology. 3/10 (30%) of the AM diagnosed by neurologists did no report ab dominal pain (AP), however, all diagnoses made by gastroenterologists did (p = 0.0035). 5/50 (10%) of the gastroenterology medical records and no neurology medical records mentioned Rome criteria.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Most of the children were diagnosed by pediatric gastroenterologists. Gastroenterolo gists rarely use the Rome criteria. Patients evaluated by neurologists are frequently diagnosed with AM even without AP (a criterion that is required for its diagnosis). Education is recommended for the correct and timely diagnosis of AM.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Childhood hydrocephalus is a common chronic medical condition. However, little is known about the burden of headache and psychological comorbidities in children living with hydrocephalus. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of these conditions among the pediatric hydrocephalus population.\n",
      "METHODS: During routine neurosurgery clinic visits from July 2017 to February 2018, the authors administered four surveys to children ages 7 years and older: Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety, PROMIS Depression, and PROMIS Fatigue. The PedMIDAS is an assessment of headache disability in pediatric and adolescent patients. The PROMIS measures are pediatric self-reported instruments to assess social and emotional health. PROMIS measures utilize T-scores (mean 50, SD 10) to compare anxiety, depression, and fatigue in specific populations to those in the US general population. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical record (hydrocephalus etiology, shunt infection, race, etc.) and tested for associations with survey measure scores.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty children completed the PedMIDAS. Ten percent of them were in the severe headache range, 5% were in the moderate range, and 5% were in the mild range. There was a statistically significant association between undergoing a cluster of shunt operations and headache burden (p = 0.003).Forty children completed all three PROMIS measures. The mean anxiety score was 45.8 (SD 11.7), and 2.5% of children scored in the severe anxiety range, 17.5% in the moderate range, and 20% in the mild range. The mean depression score was 42.7 (SD 10.0), with 2.5% of children scoring in the severe depression range, 5% in the moderate range, and 12.5% in the mild range. The mean fatigue score was 45.1 (SD 16.4), with 15% percent of children scoring in the severe fatigue range, 10% in the moderate range, and 7.5% in the mild range. There were no statistically significant associations between child anxiety, depression, or fatigue and clinical or demographic variables.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Children with hydrocephalus have an average burden of headache, anxiety, depression, and fatigue as compared to the general population overall. Having a cluster of shunt operations correlates with a higher headache burden, but no clinical or demographic variable is associated with anxiety, depression, or fatigue.\n",

      "METHODS: We analyzed data from the CaMEO study (Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes), a cross-sectional, longitudinal, Internet study, to compare sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and migraine burden/disability of opioid users vs nonusers. Covariates were entered as categorical or continuous variables. Factors associated with opioid use were identified using nested, multivariable binary logistic regression models.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 2,388 respondents with migraine using prescription medications for acute treatment, 36.3% reported that they currently used or kept on hand opioid medications to treat headaches. Current opioid users had significantly more comorbidities, greater headache-related burden, and poorer quality of life than nonusers. Regression models revealed factors significantly associated with opioid use, including male sex, body mass index, allodynia, increasing monthly headache frequency, Total Pain Index score (excluding head, face, neck/shoulder), anxiety, depression, ≥1 cardiovascular comorbidity, and emergency department/urgent care use for headache in the past 6 months. Self-reported physician-diagnosed migraine/chronic migraine was associated with significantly decreased likelihood of opioid use.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Of respondents who were using acute prescription medications for migraine, more than one-third used or kept opioids on hand, contrary to guidance. This analysis could not distinguish risk factors from consequences of opioid use; thus further research is needed to guide the development of strategies for reducing the inappropriate use of opioids in migraine.\n",

      "PURPOSE: One out of three migraine patients might have accompanying restless legs syndrome (RLS). In our study, we aimed to compare the volumes of the brain structures of migraineurs with and without RLS.\n",
      "METHODS: We had 37 female patients with migraine and 17 females as the control group. Nineteen migraineurs had no RLS (RLS<sub>0</sub>) and 18 migraineurs had comorbidity of RLS (RLS<sub>1</sub>). The volumes of the brain structures were obtained by manual measurements, volBrain, and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Manually, we measured caudate and putamen volumes. We used age, years of education, depression, anxiety scores, and total intracranial volume as covariates.\n",
      "RESULTS: According to VBM analyses, the volumes of the left superior occipital gyrus and precuneus were increased, and the substantia nigra and cuneus were decreased in the RLS<sub>1</sub> group compared with the RLS<sub>0</sub> group. RLS<sub>1</sub> patients had larger superior temporal gyrus, Brodmann area 38, and left insula, and RLS<sub>0</sub> patients had larger Brodmann area 22, right superior temporal gyrus, and Heschl gyrus compared with controls. Migraine and RLS<sub>0</sub> patients had a smaller corpus callosum anteriorly, whereas RLS<sub>1</sub> patients had a smaller splenium. Caudate volumes were larger in migraine patients via the three techniques. There was a positive relation between the caudate and putamen volumes and attack frequency.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity of RLS might be a confounding factor in structural neuroimaging studies in migraine. Deficits in the visual network seem to be related to accompanying RLS; deficits in the auditory network are particularly related to migraine.\n",

      "IMPORTANCE: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a disabling, globally prevalent disorder representing a well-known and debated clinical problem. Evidence for the most effective treatment strategy is needed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To compare 3 treatment strategies for MOH.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, randomized clinical trial with 6 months of follow-up was conducted in the tertiary sector at the Danish Headache Center, Glostrup, from October 25, 2016, to June 28, 2019. Of 483 patients with MOH referred during the inclusion period, 195 met the criteria consisting of migraine and/or tension-type headache, 18 years or older, eligibility for outpatient treatment, no severe physical or psychiatric disorder, no other addiction, and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Of these, 75 refused participation and 120 were included. Data were analyzed from July 3 to September 6, 2019.\n",
      "INTERVENTIONS: Random assignment (1:1:1 allocation) to 1 of the 3 outpatient treatments consisting of (1) withdrawal plus preventive treatment, (2) preventive treatment without withdrawal, or (3) withdrawal with optional preventive treatment 2 months after withdrawal.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in headache days per month after 6 months. Predefined secondary outcomes were change in monthly migraine days, use of short-term medication, pain intensity, number of responders, patients with remission to episodic headache, and cured MOH.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 120 patients, 102 (mean [SD] age, 43.9 [11.8] years; 81 women [79.4%]) completed the 6-month follow-up. Headache days per month were reduced by 12.3 (95% CI, 9.3-15.3) in the withdrawal plus preventive group, by 9.9 (95% CI, 7.2-12.6) in the preventive group, and by 8.5 (95% CI, 5.6-11.5) in the withdrawal group (P = .20). No difference was found in reduction of migraine days per month, use of short-term medication, or headache intensity. In the withdrawal plus preventive group, 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) reverted to episodic headache, compared with 21 of 35 (60.0%) in the preventive group and 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the withdrawal group (P = .03). Moreover, 30 of 31 patients (96.8%) in the withdrawal plus preventive group were cured of MOH, compared with 26 of 35 (74.3%) in the preventive group and 32 of 36 (88.9%) in the withdrawal group (P = .03). These findings corresponded to a 30% (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6) increased chance of MOH cure in the withdrawal plus preventive group compared with the preventive group (P = .03).\n",
      "CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: All 3 treatment strategies were effective, but based on these findings, withdrawal therapy combined with preventive medication from the start of withdrawal is recommended as treatment for MOH.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of oral paracetamol and oral ibuprofen for the management of acute headache in children with migraine without aura.\n",
      "METHODS: This randomized-controlled trial was done at the Pediatric department of a public hospital in India between 20 May, 2017 and 22 March, 2018, and enrolled children (aged 6-12 y) with Migraine without aura as per International Classification for Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria. The 50 patients (21 females, mean age 9.9 y) consecutively enrolled were randomized by block randomization to two study groups, with one group (n = 25) receiving oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) and the other group (n = 25) oral ibuprofen (10 mg/kg/dose), at home, during a single episode of acute migraine headache. The study drugs were dispensed in a blinded fashion. Pain-freedom (score of zero in a 0-10 Visual analogue pain scale) and Pain-relief (≥2-point reduction from the baseline) two-hours after the study drug intake were the primary outcomes. Side-effects to the study drugs were actively solicited. Non-parametric tests for paired data were used.\n",
      "RESULTS: The two groups were similar at baseline. Forty-three children (22 paracetamol group and 21 ibuprofen group) completed the study. Both pain-freedom (32% vs. 28%, P = 0.77) and pain-relief (80% vs. 80%, P = 0.86) were not significantly different between the Paracetamol and Ibuprofen groups, respectively. Ten (23.2%) children had a side-effect due to the study drug, with no significant difference between the groups (13.6% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.11).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are effective and safe for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in children.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Headache disorders like migraine show geographic and ethnic differences between Asian and European/North American countries. In cluster headache, these differences are rarely mentioned and discussed. This article aimed to review the characteristics of cluster headache in Asian countries and compare the clinical features to those in European and North American populations.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a narrative literature review on the demographics, clinical presentations, and treatments of cluster headache in Asian countries.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with cluster headache in Asian populations showed a stronger male predominance compared to European and North American populations. Chronic cluster headache was rare in Asian countries. The clinical presentation of restlessness was not as common in Asian as it was in European and North American countries, and Asian patients with aura were extremely rare. Patients in Asian countries may have a lower circadian rhythmicity of cluster headache and a lower headache load, as demonstrated by lower attack frequencies per day, bout frequencies, and bout durations.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in the presentation of cluster headache exist. Greater awareness for cluster headache should be raised in Asian regions, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind observed differences.\n",

      "METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of patients seen between 2007 and 2017 in a headache centre and diagnosed with PTH-CH that developed within 7 days of head trauma. A control cohort included 553 patients with primary CH without any history of trauma who attended the headache clinic during the same period. Data including demographics, attack characteristics and response to treatments were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with PTH-CH were identified. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between PTH-CH and family history of CH (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.63), chronic form (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.70 to 6.49), parietal (OR 14.82, 95% CI 6.32 to 37.39) or temporal (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.84) location of pain, and presence of prominent cranial autonomic features during attacks (miosis OR 11.24, 95% CI 3.21 to 41.34; eyelid oedema OR 5.79, 95% CI 2.57 to 13.82; rhinorrhoea OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.86; facial sweating OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.93).

      "CONCLUSION: This largest series of PTH-CH defines it as a unique entity with specific evolutive profile. Patients with PTH-CH are more likely to suffer from the chronic variant, have marked autonomic features, be intractable to treatment and have associated chronic migraine compared with primary CH.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The physiopathology underlying spontaneous coronary artery dissection remains largely unknown. Endothelial dysfunction is an early feature of many vascular disorders. We sought to determine the endothelial function assessed by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) in patients with SCAD and compare it to that of non-SCAD patients with similar cardiovascular risk profile.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a case-control study with the participation of 2 centers. Patients (cases) were diagnosed with SCAD between 2008 and 2018. Control subjects were individually matched 2:1 to SCAD cases from a cohort recruited for assessment with RH-PAT between 2006 and 2013. The primary measure variable was the mean difference in the log-transformed reactive hyperemia index (LnRH-PAT Index) between groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: LnRH-PAT data from 23 patients with SCAD and 46 matched controls were analyzed. No significant differences were noted in the matching variables (overall, 95.7% female with mean age 52.7 years). In the SCAD group, more patients reported migraine (61 vs. 21%) and more patients were on betablockers (70 vs 28%), ACE inhibitors (65 vs. 13%) and statins (70 vs. 28%), all differences statistically significant. The mean LnRH-PAT value was 0.55 ± 0.22 in patients with SCAD and 0.77 ± 0.23 in controls (mean difference: 0.22, p < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, patients with SCAD had a poorer endothelial function than similar subjects without prior SCAD. This finding opens a new venue in the research of the physio pathologic mechanisms underlying SCAD.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Onabotulinumtoxin type A (BoNTA) is manufactured as powder that requires reconstitution with normal saline prior to injection. Previous literature has suggested that preserved saline (PS) exerts a local anaesthetic effect, and reduces the procedure discomfort when used in reconstitution in lieu of preservative-free saline (PFS). However, this was mainly studied in the aesthetics indications of BoNTA, and never in its use for the treatment of chronic migraine. The distinction is important as chronic migraine population suffers high incidence of scalp allodynia which makes it more prone to injection site pain. In addition, the pain of the procedure itself may be related to the spike of migraine frequency in the immediate postprocedural period which can occur in up to 5% of patients receiving the treatment. Our trial aimed to study the difference in procedural pain scale, and postprocedural headache rating with the use of PS vs PFS in constitution of BoNTA when used as a treatment for chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: 68 subjects were consecutively enrolled in an outpatient setting at a large tertiary headache centre over a period of 6 months. Subjects were randomised into PS or PFS group. BoNTA was administered as per standard protocol in both groups. Injection site pain scores and frequency of headache days in the immediate following week were recorded. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare differences in between groups using SPSS software.\n",
      "RESULTS: Analysis (SAS V 9.4) revealed that those receiving [PF] had significantly higher procedure pain scores than those receiving [P] (5.3 vs 3.2, respectively). There was no difference in the headache or migraine frequency in the immediate postprocedural period.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of PS (bacteriostatic) over PFS for reconstitution of BoNTA in chronic migraine as it reduces the discomfort of the injection sites.\n",

      "METHODS: This retrospective study utilized clinical information (e.g. diagnosis, headache features, medication overuse, functional disability) from a large data repository of patients initially presenting to a multidisciplinary headache center with continuous headache. Patient inclusion in subgroup analyses for chronic migraine and new daily persistent headache was based on clinician diagnosis using International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria.\n",
      "RESULTS: The current sample included 1170 youth (mean age = 13.95 years, 78.8% female) with continuous headache. The overwhelming majority of these youth had headaches with migrainous features, regardless of their clinical diagnosis. Youth with chronic migraine reported a longer history of continuous headache symptoms and earlier age of headache onset than youth with new daily persistent headache and were more likely to have medication overuse. Most youth with continuous headache experienced severe migraine-related functional disability, regardless of diagnostic subgroup.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Overall, youth with continuous chronic migraine and new daily persistent headache did not have clinically meaningful differences in headache features and associated disability. Findings suggest that chronic migraine and new daily persistent headache may be variants of the same underlying disease.\n",

      "METHODS: A triple-blind clinical trial study was performed on 144 patients diagnosed with migraine. Patients were randomly allocated by a stratified method to four groups of 36 titled basil essential oil 2, 4, 6%, and placebo groups. Medications were used topically every 8 h for 3 successive months. In addition, each individual received 325 mg of acetaminophen every 12 h. The severity and frequency of migraine attacks were measured prior to the study, at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The visual analog scale was used to measure pain intensity. The marginal model and generalized estimation equations were used to compare changes in the intensity and frequency of pain over time.\n",
      "RESULTS: The interaction of the dose and time factors was significant on both pain intensity (p < 0.001) and frequency of attack (p < 0.001).

After a one-month run-in, episodic patients with at least two migraine attacks/month were randomized to receive PMES daily for 45 min or STS daily for 20 min for three months. The primary outcomes were change in monthly migraine days and the 50% response rate.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were included in this study. We observed statistically significant reduction of migraine days in the third month treatment both in the PMES group and STS group. The difference between the two groups was not significant (60.5% vs. 53.8%, p = 0.88). Of note, 77.8% patients in the PMES group and 62.2% patients in the STS group had a ≥50% reduction of migraine days in the third month (p = 0.070). The change in monthly migraine days, monthly migraine attacks, severity of migraine days, accompanying symptoms during migraine and monthly acute anti-migraine drug intake were not significantly different between the two groups. The change of Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) from run-in to the third-month treatment in the STS group was more remarkable than that in the PMES group (36.5% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.041). The occurrence of discomfort paresthesia was higher in the STS group (13.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.026).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: People with migraine have localised (i.e., cephalic) mechanical sensitivity. There is uncertainty regarding widespread (i.e., extra-cephalic) mechanical sensitivity and variations in mechanical sensitivity throughout the migraine cycle. Therefore, this study aimed (1) to comprehensively assess mechanical sensitivity in both cephalic and extra-cephalic regions during the preictal, ictal, postictal and interictal phases; and (2) to compare these findings with mechanical sensitivity at corresponding time-points and locations in healthy participants.\n",
      "METHODS: According to sample size calculations, 19 people with migraine and 19 matched healthy volunteers participated in a prospective longitudinal study. Pressure pain thresholds were evaluated in three cephalic regions (temporalis, upper trapezius and C1 paraspinal muscles) and two extra-cephalic regions (extensor carpi radialis and tibialis anterior muscle) with a digital algometer during the four phases of the migraine cycle in people with migraine and at corresponding intervals and locations in healthy participants. Linear mixed model analyses with a random intercept were used.\n",
      "RESULTS: People with migraine had increased mechanical sensitivity in cephalic and extra-cephalic regions in all phases of the migraine cycle compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, this mechanical sensitivity was more severe in the preictal, ictal and postictal phase compared to the interictal phase in cephalic and extra-cephalic regions.\n",

Compared to those with non-evening chronotypes, BD patients with an evening chronotype were younger, had an earlier age of onset of BD, and had more prior depressive and manic episodes, higher rates of rapid cycling, past suicide attempts, more comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. Multivariate regression showed age, prior suicide attempts, and co-occurring substance use disorder were associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 0.97 to1.59). Hypertension, migraine, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea were significantly associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 1.56 to 2.0).\n",
      "LIMITATION: Limitations include a cross-sectional study design that precludes establishing causality. Analyses did not control for medication use. Younger participant age may prevent evaluation of associations with late-life illnesses.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Evening chronotype may be a discrete clinical subphenotype in BD and circadian dysfunction a shared pathophysiological mechanism between psychopathology and medical morbidity.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical features of a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults with a history of status migrainosus (SM) and to describe their short-term prognosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Data on the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with SM are sparse and little is known about the prognosis of this population.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical cohort study that included patients from the Cincinnati Children's Headache Center if they had a diagnosis of migraine and data available for a 1-3 months follow-up interval. Data extracted from the initial interval visit (visit A) included: age, sex, race, migraine diagnosis, SM history, chronic migraine, medication overuse headache (MOH), body mass index (BMI), headache frequency, headache severity, disability, allodynia and lifestyle habits: caffeine intake, meal skipping, sleep duration, exercise frequency, and fluid intake. Data extracted from the initial consultation visit included: months with headache at initial consultation visit, patient endorsing \"feeling depressed\" and anxiety symptoms. Headache frequency and visit type were also measured at the second visit (visit B) in the follow-up interval. A multivariate logistic regression model with a backward elimination procedure was created to model the odds of having a diagnosis of SM using the cross-sectional predictor variables above. Second, chi-square tests were used to compare the proportion of patients with SM to the proportion of patients without SM who had each of the following outcomes in the short-term follow-up window: treatment response (50% or greater reduction in headache frequency), overall reduction in headache frequency (reduction of 1 or more headache days/month), minimal change in headache frequency (increase in 0-3 headache days/month), and clinical worsening (increase in 4 or more headache days/month).\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 5316 youth with migraine were included and 559 (10.5%) had a history of SM. In the multivariate logistic regression model, predictors significantly associated with SM were: older age (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.09-1.17, P &lt; .0001), migraine with aura (MWA) (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.65, P = .03), MOH (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.30-2.28, P = .0001), headache frequency (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.97-0.99, P = .030), higher headache severity (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15, P = .009), months with headache at initial consultation (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 1.00-1.01, P = .042), and admission to infusion center at visit B (OR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.38-3.72, P = .001). Patients with a history of SM were more likely to experience an increase in 4 or more headache days per month at follow-up: 15.2% as compared to 11.1% of those without SM, χ2 (1, n = 5316) = 8.172, P = .0043.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Youth with SM represent a distinct subgroup of the migraine population and have an unfavorable short-term prognosis.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the safety and the pharmacokinetics of dihydroergotamine (DHE) after administration of intranasal DHE powder (STS101), intranasal DHE spray (Migranal® ), and intramuscular (IM) DHE injection in healthy subjects.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a 2-part, active-controlled, 3-period crossover study over 3 weeks, separated by 1-week washout periods. In part 1, 3 ascending dosage strengths of STS101 (1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 mg) were administered to 15 healthy subjects with no history of migraine. In part 2, 27 healthy subjects were administered 1 dose each of STS101 5.2 mg, Migranal DHE Mesylate Liquid Nasal Spray 2.0 mg, and IM DHE Mesylate 1.0 mg in a randomized order. Liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine plasma levels of DHE and its major metabolite, 8'OH-DHE. Pharmacokinetic parameters (C<sub>max</sub> , T<sub>max</sub> , AUC<sub>0-2 h</sub> , AUC<sub>0-48 h</sub> , AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> , and t<sub>1/2</sub> ) for DHE and metabolite were calculated. Geometric means and 90% confidence intervals of log-transformed data were calculated and the ratio of means compared. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, subjective and objective assessments of nasal signs and symptoms, and changes in laboratory parameters. The study is registered as NCT03874832.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty-three subjects were enrolled and received study medication. Forty completed all study activities, 14 in part 1 and 26 in part 2. In part 1, DHE plasma levels showed a dose-dependent increase, with STS101 5.2 mg reaching a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 1870 pg/mL with a T<sub>max</sub> of 23 minutes. In part 2, STS101 5.2 mg showed rapid absorption, achieving mean DHE plasma concentrations of 1230 and 1850 pg/mL at 10 and 15 minutes after administration, respectively. In comparison to Migranal, STS101 5.2 mg showed approximately 2-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> (2175 vs 961 pg/mL), AUC<sub>0-2 h</sub> (2979 vs 1316 h × pg/mL), and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> (12,030 vs 6498 h × pg/mL), respectively. The mean AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> of STS101 5.2 mg was comparable to IM DHE (12,030 vs 13,650 h × pg/mL). STS101 5.2 mg showed substantially lower variability compared to Migranal for C<sub>max</sub> (41% vs 76%), AUC<sub>0-2 h</sub> (39% vs 75%), and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> (39% vs 55%). The incidence of treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), all mild and transient, reported in parts 1 and 2 combined was 9/15 (60%), 5/15 (33%), and 16/41 (39%) of the subjects after 1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 mg STS101, respectively, and 4/26 (15%) and 5/27 (19%) of the subjects after IM DHE and Migranal, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: STS101 showed rapid absorption, achieving effective DHE plasma concentrations within 10 minutes. It achieved substantially higher C<sub>max</sub> , AUC<sub>0-2 h</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> , compared to Migranal suggesting potentially better efficacy than Migranal. Its variability was better than Migranal, thus offering improved consistency of response. AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> was comparable to IM DHE, suggesting prolonged action and low recurrence. Additionally, the C<sub>max</sub> was sufficiently low to avoid any significant nausea reported with IV DHE. Thus, STS101 is an easy to administer, non-injected, acute treatment for migraine, with a favorable tolerability profile and is expected to provide rapid and consistent freedom from pain and associated migraine symptoms without recurrence.\n",

      "PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of shift work on headache. Furthermore, we investigated whether the association between shift work and headache was explained by potential mediators in terms of perceived stress, poor sleep and health behaviors.\n",
      "METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we used questionnaire data (collected in 2007 and 2009) from civil servants and hospital employees from the PRISME study. 2952 individuals were available for the analyses of shift work and headache and 2272 individuals were available for the analyses of shift work and migraine. Headache was operationalized as the participants' experience of \"being bothered by headache during the past 4 weeks\". Migraine was operationalized as \"ever being diagnosed with migraine by a medical doctor\". We used binary logistic regression to compare shift workers with permanent day workers and adjusted for socio-demographic factors. In a subsequent step, we adjusted for potential mediators.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found higher odds of unspecific headache (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.02-1.54) and migraine (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.04-2.86) among shift workers compared with day workers. Our results suggest that the effect of shift work on headache and migraine differ between men and women. Inclusion of potential mediators in the analyses did not attenuate the associations.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Shift workers have higher risk of reporting being bothered by headache as well as reporting being diagnosed with migraine. Future research is needed to disentangle the underlying mechanisms with the aim of reducing headache related to occupational exposures.\n",

      "METHODS: Participants are a random sample of recently deployed soldiers from the Warrior Strong cohort, consisting of soldiers with (n = 557) and without (n = 1,030) a history of a recent mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI; concussion). mTBI+ soldiers were subdivided as PTH+ (n = 230) and PTH- (n = 327). Headache classification was based on a detailed phenotypic questionnaire. Medical encounters for headache were documented for the year after deployment.\n",
      "RESULTS: The findings here are limited to the soldiers with headaches, consisting of 94% of the mTBI+ soldiers and 76% of the mTBI- soldiers. Other than headache duration, all headache/migraine features were more common or more severe in the PTH+ group compared to the nonconcussed group (mTBI-) and compared to the concussed group with nontraumatic headaches (PTH-). Headaches were largely similar in the mTBI- and PTH- groups. The features most specific to PTH+ included allodynia, visual aura, sensory aura, daily headache, and continuous headache. Medical consultation for headache was most common in the PTH+ group (62%) vs the PTH- group (20%) or the mTBI- group (13%) (p &lt; 0.008).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of recently deployed soldiers, PTHs are more severe, frequent, and migraine-like and more often associated with medical consultation compared to headaches presumed unrelated to concussion. Future observational studies are needed to verify and characterize the PTH phenotype, which could be followed by treatment trials with appropriate and possibly novel outcomes for prespecified subgroups.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Standard pharmacological treatment of migraine has many shortcomings. Acupuncture is becoming a more widely used therapy for the prevention and treatment of migraine, but its effectiveness is still in question when compared to the pharmacological treatments even though very few of these have Class A and B evidence for migraine prevention. This is a systematic review of data from existing randomized trials that compare the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment with conventional migraine preventative medications.\n",
      "METHODS: Custom-designed strategy was used for searching Pubmed (includes MEDLINE), Scopus (includes EMBASE). The inclusion criteria were English language and randomized trials. No date restriction was utilized. We included randomized trials and randomized controlled trials in adult patients that compared the clinical effects of acupuncture with a standard migraine preventive medication in patients with a diagnosis of chronic or episodic migraine with or without aura. We excluded letters and studies on acupuncture for headaches other than migraine. Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods, and results; and assessed the quality of the acupuncture intervention based on the American Academy of Neurology Classification of evidence matrix for therapeutic trials. The present review was not registered.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of the 706 search results, 7 clinical trials, with a total of 1430 participants, met inclusion criteria for trials comparing the effectiveness of acupuncture to standard pharmacologic treatment. Several of the studies showed acupuncture to be more effective than standard pharmacological treatments for migraine prevention; however, methodological heterogeneity precluded aggregation of these data.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that acupuncture is just as effective and has fewer side effects than many of the standard pharmaceutical agents that are currently used. However, the heterogeneity of the existing studies limits the effective comparison and analysis.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the national prevalence of depression and anxiety among children with epilepsy and determines which demographic variables and comorbidities increase the risk of these psychopathologies. We also compare the rates of depression and anxiety in pediatric epilepsy with those of other chronic health conditions in childhood.\n",
      "METHODS: We used the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs to identify children with epilepsy with and without depression and anxiety. We assessed demographic factors and comorbidities associated with depression and anxiety using weighted multivariable logistic regressions. The rates of psychiatric comorbidity in children with chronic conditions other than epilepsy were also determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: The final sample included 1042 children over the age of five with epilepsy. After applying the sampling weights, we estimated that 283,000 children between 5 and 17 years of age have epilepsy in the United States (U.S.). Among these children, 25% have depression and/or anxiety. This figure was not significantly different from the rates seen among children with asthma (16.5%) or allergies (21.6%) but was significantly lower than the rate seen among children with migraines (43.2%). In our analyses of children with epilepsy, low-income children (regardless of race) and children whose needs for specialist care were unmet (relative to those whose needs were met) were more likely to have depression. Low-income black children were less likely to have anxiety than high-income white children. Gender, age, and epilepsy severity were unrelated to depression or anxiety.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: One in four U.S. children with epilepsy has depression and/or anxiety. Therefore, physicians should consider the various factors that are related to depression and anxiety in children with epilepsy so that at-risk children can be screened and managed appropriately.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The relationship of cognitive dysfunction and vestibular dysfunction has been established by various studies. However, the available Patient-Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires that address the main vestibular complaint fail to highlight this domain of dysfunction in this patient population. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare cognitive impairment using a validated cognitive questionnaire across several vestibular diagnoses.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 186 patients presenting to a tertiary care vestibular clinic with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease (MD), benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, or persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Patients completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean CFQ scores for this cohort were significantly higher than similarly aged published controls (34.9/100 versus 31.3/100; p < 0.01; mean age, 45 years) as well as published controls between 65 and 74 years of age (34.9/100 versus 31.2/100; p < 0.05). Patients with PPPD or combined vestibular migraine and MD scored the highest on the CFQ and significantly higher than controls (45.1/100, p = 0.001; and 44.1/100, p = 0.006, respectively). Patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo had lower scores than normal controls. There is a weak but significant correlation between CFQ and DHI (r = 0.31; p < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression shows that CFQ scores were largely driven by the duration of symptoms (p < 0.001), type of diagnosis (notably PPPD; p = 0.026), and DHI (p < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cognitive impairment is prevalent with chronic vestibular disorders, even in peripheral disorders such as MD. The duration of vestibular symptoms before diagnosis (and management), as well as certain etiologies, may play a bigger role in cognitive disability than age. This is not currently well-addressed in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires and may be overlooked at the time of the diagnosis. Appropriate identification may help tailor treatment, namely rehabilitation programs, to individual patients.\n",

      "RESULTS: The VM, migraine, and control groups did not significantly differ in terms of age or sex. Compared with the migraine and control groups, the VM group had a higher incidence of poor sleep quality (χ2 = 36.618, p &lt; 0.01) and greater severity of poor sleep quality (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the VM group showed reduced sleep efficiency (p &lt; 0.01) and reduced proportions of REM and slow wave (N3) sleep (p ≤ 0.01). Conversely, sleep latency (p = 0.01) and REM latency (p = 0.04) were prolonged, and proportions of light sleep phases (N1, p &lt; 0.05, and N2, p &lt; 0.01) and the micro-arousal index (p = 0.03) were increased. The migraine group had significantly higher apnea hypopnea (AHI) and periodic leg movement (PLMI) indices than the VM group.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The injection interval for onabotulinumtoxinA (BoNTA) in the management of chronic migraine (CM) is 12 weeks (78-84 days). The aim of this study was to review patient-reported wearing off effect (WOE) of the therapeutic benefit of BoNTA near the end of the treatment cycle. We intended to describe the demographics of patients at baseline and compare groups of patients with multiple episodes of WOE.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with CM who received uninterrupted BoNTA therapy from January 2014 to March 2018. The data from patient-reported WOE (worsening headache variables and neck pain) that occurred during the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the scheduled re-injection of BoNTA for treatment cycles with injection interval ≤13 weeks and without obvious confounding factors were reviewed.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 98 eligible patients and analyzed 471 treatment cycles. Forty-three unique patients reported at least 1 occurrence of WOE. About 24/43 patients reported 1 WOE event and 19/43 patients reported ≥2 WOE events. Between the 2 groups, anxiety disorder and opioid use for headache were statistically significantly different. In the former group, the median interquartile range (IQR) dose of BoNTA was 165 (155, 175) units and the median IQR duration of the antinociceptive effect of BoNTA was 66.5 (63, 71.5) days. In the latter group, the median IQR dose of BoNTA was 167 (155, 173.3) units and the median IQR duration of the antinociceptive effect of BoNTA was 65.3 (62.5, 68.8) days. Up to 32% of these patients reported an increase in the use of abortive therapies to manage the symptoms of WOE.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: The primary goal of BoNTA in the treatment of CM is to mitigate the development of central sensitization. Since the 12-week injection paradigm may not provide sustained antinociceptive effect in all patients, it may account for the failure of response to BoNTA. Repeated occurrences of the WOE can potentially lead to medication overuse and impact quality of life.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the allodynia score in headache attacks related and not related to menstruation in women diagnosed with menstrually related migraine without aura.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Allodynia is an important symptom in migraine and has been associated with migraine chronification. No study has yet compared prospectively allodynia in menstrual vs non-menstrual attacks within the same cohort of patients.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study, where participants had the 12-item Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC-12) assessed after 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours from the onset of migraine attacks in 2 different conditions, with menstrual migraine attack (MM+) and with non-menstrual migraine attack (MM-).\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 600 women with headache complaints were screened from March 2013 to July 2014 in a headache outpatient or headache tertiary clinic. From these, 55 participants were recruited, and 32 completed the study. Participants' mean age was 27 years, BMI was 22.1, menarche age 12 years, migraine history was 11.5 years, and most women were young (ranged from 17 to 44 years of age), were in higher school (13/32 = 41%), single (20/32 = 63%), and used contraceptives (22/32 = 69%). Multiple pairwise comparisons of ANCOVA's test showed significant higher ASC-12 scores in MM+ group compared to MM- group at 2 hours [mean, 95% CI of difference: 2.3 (0.31, 4.7), P = .049)]. For the ASC-12 categorical scores (absent, mild, moderate, and severe) MM+ yielded higher scores than MM- at 1 hour (z = -3.08, P = .021) and 4 hours (z = -2.97, P = .03).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that in the patents from tertiary headache center assessed, menstrual-related migraine attacks augment allodynia scores in the beginning of attacks compared to non-menstrual migraine attacks.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Migraine is the second most common headache disorder. However, prophylactic therapy remains underutilized.\n",
      "AIMS: The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose sodium valproate and low-dose propranolol sustained release (SR) in the prophylaxis of common migraine headache.\n",
      "SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching institute. It was a randomized, prospective, parallel, open-label, clinical study.\n",
      "SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 60 patients with common migraine headaches (≥2 attacks/month) treated for 12 weeks. The patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups treated by sodium valproate 500 mg/day and propranolol SR 40 mg/day, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of responders (i.e., >50% decrease in mean headache frequency) at the end of 12 weeks and decrease in mean headache frequency (per 4 weeks) at the end of 12 weeks. The patients were assessed at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the study.\n",
      "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Intention-to-treat analysis was used for all the statistical analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-five patients completed the study. At the end of the treatment, both sodium valproate and propranolol caused a significant (P &lt; 0.0001) reduction in frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headache. Propranolol caused significantly greater reduction in the severity of headache (P = 0.0410) than sodium valproate. The percentage of responders was 60% in sodium valproate group and 70% in propranolol group. Drowsiness was the most common adverse effect noted in both the groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Both sodium valproate and propranolol significantly reduced frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headache, but propranolol caused significantly greater reduction in the severity of headache compared to sodium valproate. Both the medications were well tolerated and did not result in discontinuation.\n",

The secondary aims were to evaluate the frequency of an incorrect diagnosis of \"cervical arthrosis\" in patients unaware of having migraine and to compare the clinical features, diagnostic investigation, and treatment strategies between the 2 subgroups of migraineurs, that is, those with and without the incorrect diagnosis of \"cervical arthrosis.\"\n",
      "METHODS: Patients, between 18 and 65 years, were consecutively referred to 5 Headache Centers in 2 Italian regions for a first visit. They fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine (with/without aura, episodic/chronic) and were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Each patient underwent a specific cranial/cervical musculoskeletal clinical examination.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 117/250 subjects (46.8%) were unaware that they suffered from migraine. In these unaware subjects, the most frequently reported diagnosis was \"cervical arthrosis\" in 34/117 (29.1%), followed by tension-type headache in 23/117 (19%). The cervical region was the most common site of pain onset in the so-called \"cervical arthrosis\" group (52.9%, P < .0001), where also more pericranial (58.8%; P = .041) and neck (70.6%; P = .009) muscle tenderness, restricted range of cervical vertical (47.1%; P < .001), and lateral (29.4%; P = .040) movements were reported. More \"cervical arthrosis patients\" had been referred to an Emergency Department (88.2%; P = .011) and had undergone more cervical spine radiography (23.5%; P = .003) and magnetic resonance imaging (20.6%; P = .044). While they had used fewer triptans (11.8%; P = .007) and received less pharmacological prophylaxis (2.9%; P = .004).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, there were high misdiagnosis rates for migraine sufferers in Italy. The most common misdiagnosis, that is, \"cervical arthrosis,\" led to misuse of healthcare facilities and had a negative impact on the migraine treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate for chronic migraine (CM) prevention.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The efficacy* of onabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate has been established in placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (*defined as the benefit of treatment under ideal conditions). The effectiveness* of the 2 preventive treatments, however, has not been established (*the benefit of treatment under real-world conditions, representing a blend of efficacy and tolerability).\n",
      "METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, post-authorization, open-label prospective study (FORWARD; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02191579), we randomized adults with CM (1:1) to onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U every 12 weeks for 3 cycles or topiramate \"immediate release\" 50-100 mg/day to week 36. Primary outcome measure was proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in headache days (weeks 29-32). Missing values were imputed using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) methodology. After 12 weeks, patients initially randomized to topiramate could cross over to onabotulinumtoxinA treatment. We monitored and recorded all adverse events (AEs).\n",
      "RESULTS: We enrolled 282 patients (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 140; topiramate, n = 142) and 148 patients completed randomized treatment (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 120 [86%]; topiramate, n = 28 [20%]). Primary reasons for withdrawal were ineffective treatment (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 7 [5%]; topiramate, n = 27 [19%]) and AEs (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 5 [4%]; topiramate, n = 72 [51%]). Eighty topiramate patients crossed over to onabotulinumtoxinA. In the BOCF analysis, a significantly higher proportion of patients randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA experienced ≥50% reduction in headache frequency compared with those randomized to topiramate (40% [56/140] vs 12% [17/142], respectively; adjusted OR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.7-9.1]; P < .001). OnabotulinumtoxinA was superior to topiramate in meeting secondary endpoints. In a post hoc analysis using observed data, the 50% responder rates at week 12 were 45.6% for onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 125) and 29.4% for topiramate (n = 109) (P = .015). AEs were reported by 48% (105/220) of onabotulinumtoxinA and 79% (112/142) of topiramate patients. Results were similar in those who crossed over to onabotulinumtoxinA.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: While using imputation methods of accounting for differences in discontinuation rates, we found onabotulinumtoxinA to have greater clinical utility than topiramate, largely because of tolerability issues associated with the latter and a relatively higher number of onabotulinumtoxinA patients remaining on treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the management practices of a headache specialist with non-headache specialists in the treatment of children with migraine. The use of appropriate rescue medications and prophylactic agents, application of neuroimaging, and short-term outcomes are compared in children treated by the two groups of physicians.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by utilizing the electronic medical records of children 3-18 years of age with migraine, who were evaluated at a tertiary care children's hospital from 2016 to 2018.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 849 patients who met the study criteria, 469 children were classified as having chronic migraine or high-frequency episodic migraine and were followed-up on at least 1 occasion by the neurologists. Imaging was obtained in 66.5% of all children with migraine. The headache specialist used 5-HT agonists (\"triptans\") for migraine management in 56.7% (76/135) of cases compared to non-headache specialists who prescribed them in 28.7% (96/334) of cases (P < .001). Of the children with chronic migraine, the headache specialist evaluated 135 patients while the non-headache specialists treated 334 children. Non-headache specialists prescribed prophylaxis in the form of natural supplements more frequently (63.8% of cases) compared to the headache specialist (38.5% of children) (P < .001). Moreover, prophylaxis with prescription drugs was utilized more often by headache specialist (66.7%) than non-headache specialists (37.4%) (P < .001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Imaging appears to be commonly recommended by both headache specialists and non-headache specialists in children with migraine. The headache specialist was more likely to use triptans as rescue medications for pediatric migraine. Outcomes in the short-term were not statistically different whether children were being managed by the headache specialist or the non-headache specialists.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: ICHD-3 criteria for chronic migraine (CM) include a mixture of migraine and tension-type-like headaches and do not account for patients who have a high frequency of migraine but no other headaches.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from the Danish Headache Center and their relatives with ICHD-3 defined CM were compared with patients with high frequency episodic migraine (HFEM). Danish registries were used to compare the socioeconomic impact in these two groups. A Russian student population was used to determine the generalizability of the number of patients fulfilling CM and the proposed diagnostic criteria for CM.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was no difference in the demographic profile between the two groups in the Danish cohort. The number of lifelong or annual attacks (p &gt; 0.3), comorbid diseases, or self-reported effect of triptans (p = 1) did not differ. HFEM patients purchased more triptans than CM patients (p = 0.01). CM patients received more early pension (p = 0.00135) but did not differ from HFEM patients with regard to sickness benefit (p = 0.207), cash assistance (p = 0.139), or rehabilitation benefit (p = 1).\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Patients with HFEM are comparable to CM patients with regard to chronicity and disability. We therefore suggest classifying CM as ≥ 8 migraine days per month (proposed CM), disregarding the need for ≥ 15 headache days per month. The proposed diagnostic criteria for CM approximately doubled the number of patients with CM in both the Danish and the Russian materials. Extending the definition of CM to include patients with HFEM will ensure that patients with significant disease burden and unmet treatment needs are identified and provided appropriate access to the range of treatment options and resources available to those with CM.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with migraine on eight or more days but not 15 days with headache a month are as disabled as patients with ICHD-3 defined CM. They should be included in revised diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine.\n",

      "METHODS: Clinical studies of triptans in the treatment of acute migraines were comprehensively searched in the public databases. Pharmacodynamic models were established to describe the dose-effect and time-course of each kind of triptan for the proportion of patients who became pain free or had pain relief.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 92 articles involving 47,376 subjects were included in the analysis. After eliminating the placebo effect, oral eletriptan (40 mg) had the highest efficacy among all oral drugs at the maximum approved dose, and the proportion of patients who became pain free and had pain relief were 30.9% and 37.9% at 2 h, respectively. However, oral naratriptan (2.5 mg) had the lowest efficacy, and the proportion of patients who became pain free and had pain relief was 10.3% and 21.6% at 2 h, respectively. The efficacy of subcutaneous administration was significantly higher than that of oral administration, and the efficacy of nasal spray administration was comparable to that of oral administration. Regarding the dose-effect, the efficacy of the sumatriptan nasal spray significantly increased within the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved dose range. When the dose was increased from 5 to 20 mg of sumatriptan nasal spray, the proportion of patients who became pain free and had pain relief increased by 16.8% and 18.3% at 2 h, respectively. Regarding the time-course, the time of onset of subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) was the fastest, and the fraction of patients who were pain free at 2 h accounted for 90.6% of that at 4 h.\n",

The particular role of the hippocampus and the brainstem in the first phase of the attack, the disrupted cognitive network, and the activation of the limbic and visual systems, are the main discoveries in the field of migraine imaging that have been achieved using functional techniques. Thus advanced neuroimaging has been widely employed to study the pathogenesis of migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Concussion is a heterogeneous mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) characterized by a variety of symptoms, clinical presentations, and recovery trajectories. By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury.\n",
      "METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD).\n",
      "RESULTS: The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P < .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P < .001). Furthermore, ocular-motor in adult patients (SMD = 0.72; P < .001) and vestibular symptoms in both pediatric and adult patients (SMD = 0.18 and 0.36; P < .05) were significantly worse in concussion patients than in controls.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Five concussion subtypes with varying prevalence within 3 d following injury are commonly seen clinically and identifiable upon systematic literature review. Sleep disturbance, a concussion-associated condition, is also common. There was insufficient information available for analysis of cervical strain. A comprehensive acute concussion assessment defines and characterizes the injury and, therefore, should incorporate evaluations of all 5 subtypes and associated conditions.\n",

Respondents were stratified by episodic migraine (<15 headache days/month) and chronic migraine (≥15 headache days/month) and sex for comparisons.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 13,064 respondents (episodic migraine: 11,944 [91.4%]; chronic migraine: 1120 [8.6%]) provided valid data. Approximately 16.8% of respondents not currently in a romantic relationship (n = 536 of 3189) and 17.8% of those in a relationship but not living together (n = 236 of 1323) indicated that headaches had contributed to relationship problems.

Of individuals responding to career/finance items (n = 13,061/13,036), 32.7% indicated that headaches negatively affected ≥1 career area (n = 4271; episodic migraine: n = 3617 of 11,942 [30.3%]; chronic migraine: n = 654 of 1119 [58.4%]), and 32.1% endorsed worry about long-term financial security due to migraine (n = 4180; episodic migraine: n = 3539 of 11,920 [29.7%]; chronic migraine: n = 641 of 1116 [57.4%]).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine can negatively affect many important aspects of life including marital, parenting, romantic and family relationships, career/financial achievement and stability, and overall health. Reported burden was consistently greater among those with chronic migraine than among people with episodic migraine; however, few differences were seen between the sexes.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Prevalence of migraine, as a chronic neurovascular disorder, was approximately 10.3 and 23.1% among men and women, respectively, mostly in people younger than 40 years old. Migraine is prevalent in different geographic areas worldwide. The present study was designed to compare the impact of intranasal lidocaine 4% and peppermint essential oil drop 1.5% on migraine attacks.\n",
      "METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 120 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine based on the International Headache Society criteria were treated with intranasal lidocaine drop 4% or peppermint essential oil drop 1.5% or placebo. Patients expressed their symptoms 5 and 15 min after dripping, and if they still had a headache after 15 min, they were given the second dose. Patients with a second dose of medication, 15 min later recorded their headache rate. All patients recorded their symptoms after 30 min. Symptoms of the patients were followed by a researcher through the phone and in-person after 2 months. Then, the questionnaires were filled.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the present study, there was a significant difference among groups in headache intensity after treatment (P &lt; 0.001). In 40% of the patients in the peppermint oil and lidocaine groups, the intensity of headache decreased. In the placebo group, fewer patients responded highly to the treatment, whereas 41.5% of patients in the lidocaine group and 42.1% of patients in the peppermint oil group responded to the treatment considerably.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Concerning the findings of the present study, nasal application of peppermint oil caused considerable reduction in the intensity and frequency of headache and relieved majority of patients' pain similar to lidocaine. On the basis of findings of this study, it can be concluded that nasal menthol, such as lidocaine, can be used to relieve migraine headaches.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: There is a significant unmet need for new, effective and well tolerated acute migraine treatments. A recent study has demonstrated that a novel remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) treatment provides superior clinically meaningful pain relief with a low rate of device-related adverse events. The results reported herein compare the efficacy of REN with current standard of care in the acute treatments of migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis on a subgroup of participants with migraine from a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled, multicenter study on acute care. The original study included a 2-4 weeks run-in phase, in which migraine attacks were treated according to patient preference (i.e., usual care) and reported in an electronic diary; next, participants entered a double-blind treatment phase in which they treated the attacks with an active or sham device. The efficacy of REN was compared to the efficacy of usual care or pharmacological treatments in the run-in phase in a within-subject design that included participants who treated at least one attack with the active REN device and reported pain intensity at 2 h post-treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 252 patients randomized, there were 99 participants available for analysis. At 2 h post-treatment, pain relief was achieved in 66.7% of the participants using REN versus 52.5% participants with usual care (p < 0.05). Pain relief at 2 h in at least one of two attacks was achieved by 84.4% of participants versus 68.9% in usual care (p < 0.05). REN and usual care were similarly effective for pain-free status at 2 h. The results also demonstrate the non-inferiority of REN compared with acute pharmacological treatments and its non-dependency on preventive medication use.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: REN is an effective acute treatment for migraine with non-inferior efficacy compared to current acute migraine therapies. Together with a very favorable safety profile, these findings suggest that REN may offer a promising alternative for the acute treatment of migraine and could be considered first line treatment in some patients.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare self-perceived health between migraine and early stages of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and to explore whether and how accurate those health domains predict overall quality of life.\n",
      "METHODS: Ninety patients aged 18-55 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Thirty follow-up outpatients were recruited with migraine (with or without aura), 30 patients with RRMS, and 30 healthy subjects. They were asked to complete the Health status questionnaire (SF-36) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI).\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with RRMS and migraine had significantly worse self-reported health regarding role limitation due to physical problems and general health than the healthy control group. Additionally, migraine patients had more bodily pain, while RRMS patients expressed more difficulties regarding physical functioning. Differences between migraine and RRMS patients were not significant. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that role limitation due to physical problems, mental health, and general health represents significant predictors of overall quality of life.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine may affect quality of life similarly to early stages of RRMS. Bio-psycho-socio-medical understanding of the two diseases and their impact on patients QoL should be reconsidered.\n",

Our objective was to assess the performance of the pARC in community emergency departments (EDs) and to compare its performance with that of the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS).\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a prospective validation study from October 1, 2016, to April 30, 2018, in 11 community EDs serving general populations. Patients aged 5 to 20.9 years and with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and less than or equal to 5 days of right-sided or diffuse abdominal pain were eligible for study enrollment. Our primary outcome was the presence or absence of appendicitis within 7 days of the index visit. We reported performance characteristics and secondary outcomes by pARC risk strata and compared the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of the PAS and pARC.\n",
      "RESULTS: We enrolled 2,089 patients with a mean age of 12.4 years, 46% of whom were male patients. Appendicitis was confirmed in 353 patients (16.9%), of whom 55 (15.6%) had perforated appendixes. Fifty-four percent of patients had very low (<5%) or low (5% to 14%) predicted risk, 43% had intermediate risk (15% to 84%), and 4% had high risk (≥85%). In the very-low- and low-risk groups, 1.4% and 3.0% of patients had appendicitis, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.92) for the pARC compared with 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.82) for the PAS.\n",

The patients with CDH was categorised to MOH was based on ICHDIIR and ICHD-3 beta criteria. Their demographic and headache characteristics including frequency, duration, severity and disability were noted. Severity of headache was assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Predictors of MOH were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Demographic and headache characteristics of CDH patients without MOH were compared with those with MOH.\n",
      "RESULTS: 202 patients were included whose median age was 32 (range 18-65) years, and 151(74.8%) were females. 12.3% patients fulfilled ICHDIIR criteria for MOH and 46.5% fulfilled ICHD-3 beta criteria. The predictors of MOH were female gender (OR = 3.72; 95% CI 1.72-8.02, p = 0.001), low education level (OR = 1.07, 95%CI 1.02-1.13; p = 0.007) and higher VAS score (OR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.51-0.88; p = 0.004). MOH patients as per ICHD-3 beta criteria had higher education (p = 0.02) and consumed lesser abortive drugs (p = 0.03) as compared with ICHDIIR criteria.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The frequency of MOH increases by four-fold when using ICHD-3 beta criteria instead of ICHDIIR criteria. Females with lower education level predispose to MOH.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a frequent chief complaint of patients in the emergency department. A wide range of treatments are used for acute migraine.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the therapeutic effects of a combination of metoclopramide + dexamethasone with those of ketorolac for treatment of acute migraine in the emergency department.\n",
      "METHOD: This quasi-experimental study enrolled patients identified as migraine headache cases admitted to the emergency departments of Shohadaye Tajrish and Sina hospitals, Tehran, Iran. The patients were divided into two groups and treated with either 8 mg Dexamethasone + 10 mg Metoclopramide or 60 mg ketorolac, and then compared regarding the rate of pain control based on visual analogue scale (VAS) on arrival and 1 and 2 hours afterward.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall, 86 patients were recruited, of whom 50 were male (58.1%). Their mean age was 37.6 ± 10.3 years. Thirty-five (40.7%) were in the ketorolac group and 51 (59.3%) were in the dexamethasone + metoclopramide group. Treatment success was defined as a reduction of at least 3 points in pain severity in comparison to the admission time. One hour after administration of medications, the reported pain intensity was 4.7 ± 2.0 and 6.2 ± 2.3 in ketorolac group and dexamethasone + metoclopramide group, respectively. By the second hour, pain intensity was 3.4 ± 1.2 and 2.9 ± 1.3 in ketorolac group and dexamethasone + metoclopramide group, respectively. The two groups did not show a significant difference in terms of the reported pain at this time (p= 0.04).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, the pain reduction time was relatively shorter for ketorolac in acute migraine, but the final response was identical in the two groups.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are safe and efficacious therapies for the prevention of migraine. In this study we assessed the effects of discontinuation of preventive erenumab and galcanezumab treatment in patients with chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective pooled analysis included completers of the open-label extension study phase for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine with galcanezumab (NCT02614261; 9 months) and erenumab (NCT02174861; 12 months) in a single headache center. We compare migraine data until week 12 after open-label treatment completion, when patients did not have any pharmacological preventive medication, to study baseline values of the double-blind trial period, and to the last 4 weeks of the open-label extension. The assessment included changes in monthly migraine days, headache hours, days with severe headache and acute headache medication use.\n",
      "RESULTS: Data from 16 patients after galcanezumab (n = 9) and erenumab (n = 7) open-label treatment completion were analyzed. The mean number of monthly migraine days was 18.38 ± 3.74 at baseline, and 12.19 ± 4.53 in the last 4 weeks of the open-label extension (p < 0.001). Monthly migraine days remained significantly reduced compared to baseline during the entire 12-week observation period after open-label termination (p = 0.002), with a reduction of 5.38 ± 4.92 in weeks 1-4 (p = 0.001), 4.75 ± 4.15 in weeks 5-8 (p = 0.001), and 3.93 ± 5.45 in weeks 9-12 (p = 0.014).

      "BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels may have a role in migraine as some substances known to cause headache activate the channel. In the craniovascular system such activation causes a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-dependent increase in meningeal blood flow. TRPA1 channels in the endothelium of cerebral arteries cause vasodilation when activated. The headache preventive substance feverfew inhibits activation of TRPA1 channels. In this study we aim to compare and characterize the effect of the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) on the diameter of rat dural and pial arteries in vivo.\n",
      "METHODS: The genuine closed-cranial window technique in rats was used to examine changes in dural and pial artery diameter and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) after intracarotid infusion of AITC. Blockade experiments were performed by intravenous infusion of olcegepant, HC-030031, sumatriptan or capsazepine immediately after infusion of AITC, in four different groups of rats.\n",
      "RESULTS: AITC caused a significant dilation of dural arteries, which was inhibited by HC-030031, olcegepant and sumatriptan, but not by capsazepine. In pial arteries AITC caused a significant dilation, which was not inhibited by any of the pre-treatments, suggesting a poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier or autoregulation due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mediated decrease in MABP during HC-030031 infusion. AITC did not cause a significant change in MABP.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: AITC causes dilation of dural arteries via a mechanism dependent on CGRP and TRPA1 that is sensitive to sumatriptan. AITC causes a small but significant dilation of pial arteries.\n",

      "METHODS: We investigated dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of the migraine brain in 89 interictal migraine patients and 70 healthy controls. We focused on the temporal properties of thalamocortical connectivity using sliding window cross-correlation, clustering state analysis, and graph-theory methods. Relationships between clinical symptoms and abnormal dFNC were evaluated using a multivariate linear regression model.\n",
      "RESULTS: Five dFNC brain states were identified to characterize and compare dynamic functional connectivity patterns. We demonstrated that migraineurs spent more time in a strongly interconnected between-network state, but they spent less time in a sparsely connected state. Interestingly, we found that abnormal posterior thalamus (pulvinar nucleus) dFNC with the visual cortex and the precuneus were significantly correlated with headache frequency of migraine. Further topologic measures revealed that migraineurs had significantly lower efficiency of information transfer in both global and local dFNC.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical characteristics of cluster headache (CH) are based mainly on retrospective attack descriptions of 'usual' attacks, but whether these reports are reliable is uncertain. The aim was to compare retrospective and prospective attack descriptions and describe the within- and between-patient variability of attacks.\n",
      "METHOD: Fifty-seven CH patients underwent a semi-structured interview obtaining a retrospective account of usual CH attacks. Patients thereafter prospectively recorded the clinical characteristics of up to 10 attacks per patient in a headache diary. Four different attack characteristics were investigated: (i) severity, (ii) duration, (iii) number of autonomic symptoms and (iv) number of migrainous symptoms. Retrospective and prospective data were compared. Within- and between-patient variability of attacks was assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retrospective attack descriptions (n = 57) were significantly longer (P = 0.046) and more severe (P < 0.0001) for untreated attacks compared with prospective reports (n = 500). The number of autonomic symptoms was significantly higher in the retrospective reports compared to the prospective reports (P < 0.0001). Within-patient variability for attack duration, pain severity and number of autonomic and migrainous symptoms was low. Compared to men, more women reported longer (P = 0.026) and more severe (P = 0.028) attacks with more migrainous symptoms (P = 0.033).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Important differences were found between prospectively and retrospectively reported attacks with duration and severity of untreated attacks overestimated in retrospective attack descriptions. CH attacks display low within-patient variability, but the presentation of CH attacks varies between patients. The high prevalence of symptoms typically associated with migraine should raise more diagnostic awareness for CH, especially in women who are more often misdiagnosed as having migraine.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: Using the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), we report the burden of primary headache disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) from 1990 to 2016.\n",
      "METHODS: We modelled headache disorders using DisMod-MR 2.1 Bayesian meta-regression tool to ensure consistency between prevalence, incidence, and remission. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying prevalence and disability weight (DW) of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). We assumed primary headache disorders as non-fatal, so their YLD is equal to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\n",
      "RESULTS: Migraine and TTH were the second and twentieth leading causes of YLDs in EMR. Between 1990 and 2016, the absolute YLD numbers of migraine and TTH increased from 2.3 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.5-3.2) to 4.7 million (95%UI: 3-6.5) and from 383 thousand (95%UI: 240-562) to 816 thousand (95%UI: 516-1221), respectively. During the same period, age-standardised YLD rates of migraine and TTH in EMR increased by 0.7% and 2.5%, respectively, in comparison to a small decrease in the global rates (0.2% decrease in migraine and TTH). The bulk of burden due to headache occurred in the 30-49 year age group, with a peak at ages 35-44 years. The age-standardised YLD rates of both headache disorders were higher in women with female to male ratio of 1.69 for migraine and 1.38 for TTH. All countries of the EMR except for Somalia and Djibouti had higher age-standardised YLD rates for migraine and TTH in compare to the global rates. Libya and Saudi Arabia had the highest increase in age-standardised YLD rates of migraine and TTH, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that primary headache disorders are a major and a growing cause of disability in EMR. Since 1990, burden of primary headache disorders has constantly been higher in EMR compared to rest of the world, which indicates that health systems in EMR must focus further on developing and implementing preventive and management strategies to control headache.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of buccally absorbed prochlorperazine (BAP) to intravenous prochlorperazine (IVP) for the abortive treatment of migraine headaches.\n",
      "METHODS: Randomized double-blind trial. Eighty subjects aged 18-65 presenting with migraines to the ED of a safety-net, urban hospital. Subjects were randomized to receive either 6 mg BAP plus 2.25 mL saline IV placebo or 10 mg IVP and buccally absorbed saccharine pill placebo. A 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain, nausea, and sedation. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eighty subjects were recruited from November 2016 to December 2017; 79 completed the study. Demographics: 60 women and 19 men with a mean age of 38 ± 12.2 years. Initial mean VAS pain scores were similar between groups (BAP: 78.5 ± 19.9 mm vs IVP: 76.9 ± 19.5 mm). The improvement in mean VAS pain scores over 60 minutes for the BAP group was not significantly different from the IVP group (-54.9 ± 29.7 mm vs -66.7 ± 23.2 mm, respectively; P = 0.08). No significant differences were found in rates of nausea or sedation. Nine subjects in the BAP group required rescue treatment compared to 1 in the IVP group. Five subjects reported symptoms consistent with akathisia in the IVP group while no adverse effects were reported in the BAP group.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Buccally absorbed prochlorperazine (BAP) is an effective, non-invasive treatment for migraine headaches when compared to intravenous prochlorperazine (IVP).\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to cryptogenic stroke (CS) caused by the patent foramen ovale (PFO). This study aims to compare contrast transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE) and contrast transcranial Doppler (cTCD) to determine whether cTTE is more suitable and reliable than cTCD for clinical use.\n",
      "METHODS: From March 2017 to May 2018, patients who suffered from migraines, stroke, hypomnesis, or asymptomatic stroke found casually were included in our study. Patients with CS were semirandomly divided into two groups (cTTE and cTCD) according to the date of the outpatient visit. Patients with either of the examination above found positive were selected to finish transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).\n",
      "RESULTS: In our study, the sensitivities of group cTTE positive (group cTTE+) and group cTCD positive (group cTCD+) did not have any statistical difference (89% vs. 80%, p = 0.236). Focusing on group cTCD+, we discovered that the semiquantitative shunt grading was not correlated with whether a PFO was present or not (p = 0.194). However, once the PFO has been diagnosed, the shunt grading was shown to be related to the width of the gaps (p = 0.032, p<sub>deviation</sub>  = 0.03).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Both cTTE and the cTCD can be used for preliminary PFO findings. The semiquantitative shunt grading of cTCD and cTTE can suggest the size of the PFO and the next course of treatment. The cTTE may be more significant to a safe PFO (a PFO does not have right-to-left shunts, RLSs). Combining cTTE and TEE could help diagnose PFO and assess CS risk.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: To compare analgesia with metoclopramide and diphenhydramine vs. intranasal ketamine among ED patients with primary headache.\n",
      "METHODS: We enrolled a convenience sample of adults with a primary headache in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomized patients to either a control arm (intravenous metoclopramide and diphenhydramine) or intranasal ketamine. The primary outcome was change in pain 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) score measured at study start and 30 min post completion of initial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included side effects, hospital admission, and return to care within 48-72 h.\n",
      "RESULTS: All 53 enrolled subjects completed the study, 26 of whom were allocated to the control arm and 27 to intranasal ketamine. The mean change in pain VAS score at 30 min post intervention was 22.2 mm in the control arm vs. 29.0 in the intranasal ketamine arm (effect size difference 6.8 mm, 95% confidence interval -5.8-19.4). The incidence of reported side effects was 65.4% in the control arm vs. 66.7% in the ketamine arm. Three patients (11.5%) allocated to the control arm required admission for headache pain control vs. 1 patient (3.7%) in the intranasal ketamine arm. Three (11.5%) additional patients in the control arm returned to the ED within 48-72 h for headache pain vs. none in the ketamine arm.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy and migraine are paroxysmal neurological conditions associated with disturbances of cortical excitability. No useful biomarkers to monitor disease activity in these conditions are available. Phase clustering was previously described in electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to photic stimulation and may be a potential epilepsy biomarker.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate EEG phase clustering in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), compare it with photic stimulation in controls, and explore its potential as a biomarker of genetic generalized epilepsy or migraine with aura.\n",
      "METHODS: People with (possible) juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), migraine with aura, and healthy controls underwent single-pulse TMS with concomitant EEG recording during the interictal period. We compared phase clustering after TMS with photic stimulation across the groups using permutation-based testing.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included eight people with (possible) JME (five off medication, three on), 10 with migraine with aura, and 37 controls. The TMS and photic phase clustering spectra showed significant differences between those with epilepsy without medication and controls. Two phase clustering-based indices successfully captured these differences between groups. One participant was tested multiple times. In this case, the phase clustering-based indices were inversely correlated with the dose of antiepileptic medication. Phase clustering did not differ between people with migraine and controls.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We present methods to quantify phase clustering using TMS-EEG and show its potential value as a measure of brain network activity in genetic generalized epilepsy. Our results suggest that the higher propensity to phase clustering is not shared between genetic generalized epilepsy and migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Guanfacine is Food and Drug Administration approved for hypertension and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and has been used off-label for migraine prophylaxis, heroin withdrawal, and more recently smoking cessation. Previous studies have shown positive effects of 3 mg/d of immediate-release (IR) guanfacine on smoking outcomes, but the dose equivalency of the IR and extended-release (ER) formulations is unknown.\n",
      "PROCEDURES: A within-subject design was used to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 3 mg/d of IR, 4 mg/d of ER, and 6 mg/d of ER guanfacine in adult daily smokers (n = 5). Plasma medication levels, vital signs, cigarettes per day, tobacco craving, and adverse events were assessed. Medication was titrated to stable dosing after each laboratory day (3 mg/d IR, then 4 mg/d ER, then 6 mg/d ER).\n",
      "RESULTS: Plasma medication levels did not differ between the 3 mg/d of IR and 4 mg/d of ER doses after 24 hours from last dose and were highest at the 6 mg/d of ER dose (3 mg/d IR: M = 3.40 ng/mL, SE = 0.34 vs 4 mg/d ER: M = 3.46 ng/mL, SE = 0.67 vs 6 mg/d ER: M = 5.92 ng/mL, SE = 1.02). All doses of guanfacine decreased heart rate and blood pressure from baseline. Absolute values of cigarettes per day (6 mg/d ER) and tobacco craving (4 and 6 mg/d ER) were lowest with the ER formulations. Treatment-emergent adverse events were subject rated as minimal to mild, except dry mouth.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic profiles between 3 mg/d of IR guanfacine and 4 mg/d of ER guanfacine, as hypothesized. All doses of guanfacine were well tolerated.\n",

Yet, few studies examine the effect of comorbid migraine on health care utilization and expenses in obese US adults. This study aimed to identify risk factors for migraine and compare the use of health care services and expenses between migraineurs and non-migraineurs in obese US adults.\n",
      "SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This 7-year retrospective study used longitudinal panel data from 2006 to 2013 from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to identify obese adults reporting migraines. Outcomes compared in migraineurs vs non-migraineurs were as follows: annualized per-person medical care, prescription drug, and total health expenses.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 23,596 obese adults, 4.7% reported migraine (n=1,025) approximating 3 million civilian noninstitutionalized US individuals. Logistic regression showed that the following sociodemographic characteristics increased migraine risk: age (18-45 years), females, White race, poor perceived health status, and greater Charlson comorbidity index. Migraineurs showed US$1,401 (P=0.007), US$813 (P&lt;0.001), and US$2,213 (P=0.001) greater annual medical, prescription drug, and total health expenses than non-migraineurs, respectively.

      "INTRODUCTION: Migraine and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are both common diseases and TMD are reported as a risk factor in migraine progression. OnabotulinumtoxinA is used in the treatment of chronic migraine (CM), and also has a potential role in TMD treatment. In this study, it is aimed to compare the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in CM patients with and without TMD.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 CM patients (age range: 18-65 years), satisfying the inclusion and follow-up criteria in their medical records were investigated. The PREEMPT injection protocol was taken as reference and onabotulinumtoxinA 155-195 U with fixed-dose has been administered into 31 specific sites within the head/neck muscles in included subjects. Two cycles of treatment were assessed in all patients at the baseline and 12 weeks later. The headache diaries, which were completed routinely one month before, and during 6 months follow-up after the treatment, were assessed. The effect of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment was compared between CM patients with and without TMD/bruxism.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 30 female patients, 17 had concomitant TMD. In week 24, there were significant improvement in the groups with and without TMD regarding to the mean change of frequencies in the days with migraine compared to the initial findings (p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA is an effective and safe treatment for CM. Its efficacy appears to be similar in CM patients with and without TM, speculating that the comorbidity of TMD did not play a role for the treatment response.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The current study was designed to assess the effect of supplementation with a 14-strain probiotic mixture on episodic and chronic migraine characteristics.\n",
      "METHODS: Forty episodic and 39 chronic migraine patients who completed this randomized double-blind controlled trial received two capsules of multispecies probiotic or placebo. The migraine severity was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). The number of abortive drugs consumed, migraine days, frequency and duration of attacks were recorded on paper-based headache diaries. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and C- reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured at baseline and the end of the intervention.\n",
      "RESULTS: After a 10-week intervention, among episodic migraineurs the mean frequency of migraine attacks significantly reduced in the probiotic group compare to the placebo group (mean change: -2.64 vs. 0.06; respectively, p < 0.001). A significant reduction was also evident in the migraine severity (mean decrease: -2.14 in the probiotic group and 0.11 in the placebo group; p < 0.001). Episodic migraineurs who received the probiotic also showed significant reduction in abortive drug usage per week (mean change: -0.72; p < 0.001) compare to baseline, while there was no significant changes within the placebo group. In chronic migraine patients, after an 8-week intervention, the mean frequency of migraine attacks significantly reduced in the probiotic compared to the placebo group (mean change: -9.67 vs. -0.22; p ≤ 0.001). In contrast to the placebo, probiotic supplementation significantly decreased the severity (mean changes: -2.69; p ≤ 0.001), duration (mean changes: -0.59; p ≤ 0.034) of attacks and the number of abortive drugs taken per day (mean changes: -1.02; p < 0.001), in chronic migraine patients. We failed to detect any significant differences in the serum levels of inflammatory markers at the end of the study either in chronic or in episodic migraineurs.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: The results of this study showed that the 14-strain probiotic mixture could be an effective and beneficial supplement to improve migraine headache in both chronic and episodic migraineurs. Further research is required to confirm our observations.\n",

      "CONTEXT: Modern research with mediums-individuals who regularly experience and report communication from the deceased-includes investigations of mediums' accuracy, psychology, phenomenology, and electrophysiology and the therapeutic potential of mediumship readings for the bereaved. Anecdotal reports imply that chronic medical problems may be a serious concern for mediums.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was two-fold: (I) to systematically investigate the hematological and psychophysiological correlates of anomalous information reception (AIR, the reporting of accurate and specific information about the deceased in the absence of prior knowledge, feedback, or deceptive means) and (II) to compare the reported health issues of mediums and non-mediums.\n",
      "DESIGN: (I) A repeated-measures design in which mediums engaged in blinded mediumship readings and a control condition was used. (II) A parallel-groups design was used to compare mediums' and non-mediums' responses to an anonymous online survey regarding their health issues.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: (I) Data was collected from five Windbridge Certified Research Mediums. (II) Survey responses from 125 mediums were compared to responses from 222 non-mediums.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (I) General physiological measures and 28 hematological elements were assessed. (II) Reports regarding autoimmune disease diagnoses and specific ailments by organ system were collected.\n",
      "RESULTS: Novel findings from this study included the following: (I) No significant hematological or physiological changes were seen in the mediums when pre- and post-condition comparisons were made for the counter-balanced sessions. (II) Compared to non-mediums, more mediums reported having at least one autoimmune disease (35.2% vs. 18.9%; p = 0.00076; z = 3.37; h = 0.4). Mediums also reported experiencing more health issues than did non-mediums (8.08 ± 5.38 vs. 5.09 ± 4.17 symptoms; p < 0.000001, g = 0.6). Specifically, more mediums than non-mediums (all p < 0.004) reported water retention (19.2% vs. 5.0%, z = 4.23, h = 0.5), bruising easily (20.0% vs. 9.0%, z = 2.93, h = 0.3), gastrointestinal issues (35.2% vs. 18.5%, z = 3.48, h = 0.4), headaches/migraines (26.4% vs. 11.3%, z = 3.63, h = 0.4), asthma (20.0% vs. 9.0%, z = 2.93, h = 0.3), food intolerances (28.0% vs. 9.9%, z = 4.37, h = 0.5), and sleep disturbances (40.8% vs. 14.9%, z = 5.41 h = 0.6). The proportions of participants reporting exophthalmos, chronic fatigue syndrome, and ankle sprains were not different.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Traditional Medicine (TM) is widely accepted to be used for the treatment headache disorders in Kuwait however, researches remain poorly documented. We aimed to study the frequency of TM use and its impact in the primary headache patients.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a cross sectional self-reported efficacy study, which was conducted in Headache clinic in Kuwait throughout 6 months. Patients who were diagnosed with primary headache disorders of both genders aged from 18 to 65 years were included. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to patients who used TM in the previous year. It included demographic, and characteristics of headache (headache frequency, duration, number of analgesic used in days per month and severity of headache). TM queried included blood cupping (Hijama), head banding, herbal medicine (sabkha), and diet modification. It assessed characters of headache before and 3 months after the final TM session. Independent sample t test, paired sample t test and Chi-square test were used to compare between different values. P < 0.05 is considered significant.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 279 patients were included. The mean age is 40.32 ± 11.75 years; females represented 79.6% of the cohort. Most patients (n = 195; 69.9%) reported the use of TM before presentation to headache clinic, mainly Hijama (47.3%). Cultural / religious beliefs were the cause of seeking TM in 51.3% versus 10% used it due to ineffective medical treatment and 8.6% used it because of intolerance of medical treatment. Patients used TM were older at the onset of headache (24.24 ± 10.67 versus 20.38 ± 8.47; p < 0.003), and had longer headache disease duration (19.26 ± 13.13 versus 16.12 ± 11.39; p < 0.044). All patients with chronic headache (100%) and most of episodic migraine patients (90.4%) sought TM while only (31.5%) of Tension type headache sought TM; p < 0.047. Patients who sought TM had more frequent episodes of headache, longer duration of attacks and higher number of days of analgesic-usage respectively over last 3 months before presentation to our side (9.66 ± 7.39 versus 4.14 ± 2.72; p < 0.001), (41.23 ± 27.76 versus 32.19 ± 23.29; p <. 0009), (8.23 + 7.70 versus 3.18 ± 3.06; p < 0.001). At 3 months after the final TM session, there was no significant reduction of frequency of headache days per month (9.19 ± 7.33 versus 8.99 ± 7.59; p < 0.50), days of analgesic use per month (7.45 ± 7.43 versus 6.77 ± 6.93; p < 0.09) and duration of headache (41.23 ± 27.76 versus 41.59 ± 27.69; p < 0.78). However, there was a significant reduction of the severity of headache (p < 0.02). Few patients (17.9%) reported adverse events with TM. Most of TM cohorts were not satisfied after receiving this type of medicine.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: TM was widely used in Kuwait for primary headache. Patients sought TM before seeking physician because they found them more congruent with their own cultural and religious beliefs. Health care professionals involved in the management of headache should be aware of this and monitor potential benefits or adverse events of TM. The usage of TM was not effective in reducing headache attacks and severity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is common and associated with certain comorbidities. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of selected comorbidities in patients with RAUs and to compare the risks of comorbidity between the two cohorts of patients with or without RAUs based on the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database.\n",
      "METHODS: This case-control study included patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (the RAS cohort) and patients without recurrent aphthous stomatitis using 1:1 matching for year of index date, age, sex, monthly income, geographical location, and urbanization level (the non-RAS cohort). We calculated the prevalence of 31 medical comorbidities based on a modified version of the Elixhauser comorbidity index within 1 year before and after the index date. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to compare the risks of each comorbidity between the two cohorts.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with the non-RAS cohort, the RAS cohort had a significantly higher prevalence of 16 comorbidities, with 2% or higher prevalence difference for hyperlipidemia (2.9%), headaches (6.9%), liver diseases (2.8%), and peptic ulcers (5.4%). The adjusted odds ratios were >1.5 for headaches (1.92), migraines (1.62), hypothyroidism (1.50), rheumatoid arthritis (1.92), ankylosing spondylitis (1.94), systemic lupus erythematosus (1.82), liver diseases (1.51), peptic ulcers (1.69), hepatitis (1.62), depression (1.76), and psychoses (1.50).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis were associated with increased risk of specific comorbidities. Physicians should screen for these comorbidities for early detection and treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: To summarize the baseline methods for the Migraine in America Symptoms and Treatment (MAST) Study and evaluate gender differences in sociodemographics and headache features; consultation and diagnosis patterns; and patterns of acute and preventive treatment use for migraine among study participants.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The MAST Study is a longitudinal, internet-based panel study of symptoms, approaches to management, and unmet treatment needs among US adults with migraine. This analysis focuses on the initial cross-sectional survey, conducted beginning in 2016, and is intended to update results from earlier national epidemiologic surveys of people with migraine in the United States.\n",
      "METHODS: Respondents to the MAST Study were recruited from a US nationwide online research panel. Stratified random sampling identified a representative cohort of adults (aged ≥18 years). We administered a validated diagnostic screener based on modified ICHD-3 beta criteria to identify individuals with migraine averaging at least 1 monthly headache day (MHD) over the previous 3 months. A baseline assessment evaluated sociodemographic and headache features, patterns of consultation and diagnosis, and use of acute and preventive medications for migraine. Frequency data and chi-square contrasts (P < .05) were used to compare respondents based on gender.\n",
      "RESULTS: Baseline survey data (N = 95,821) identified 18,353 respondents who met criteria for migraine, including 15,133 (women n = 11,049, men n = 4084) reporting at least 1 MHD for the preceding 3 months. The mean age of the sample was 43.1 (13.6) years; 73.0% of respondents were women, and 81.0% were Caucasian. Compared with men, women were younger (46.1 vs 42.0 years; P < .001); had more MHDs (5.6 vs 5.3; P < .001); and were more likely to report moderate or severe headache-related disability (45.9% vs 35.8%; P < .001) and cutaneous allodynia (43.7% vs 29.5%; P < .001). The lifetime rate of medical consultation for headache was 79.8% overall and slightly higher in women than in men. Women were more likely than men to have been diagnosed with migraine (48.3% vs 38.8%, P < .001). While 95.1% of people with migraine currently used acute treatment, the majority (58.9%) used over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to the exclusion of prescription drugs, while 11.3% used exclusively prescription drugs, and 20.5% used both. Among acute prescription medication users, women were more likely than men to take triptans (17.7% vs 14.3%, P < .001), while men were more likely than women to take opioids (14.5% vs 9.2%, P < .001). Oral formulations were used predominately (92.7% of the medication users), but men were more likely to use nasal sprays (13.6% vs 9.4%, P < .001) and injectables (7.9% vs 3.4%, P <  .001). Men (14.5%) were also significantly more likely than women (10.4%) to be taking daily oral preventive medication (P < .001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The MAST Study identified a large sample of women and men with migraine from a sampling frame that broadly resembles the US population. Low participation rate increases the risk of response bias, however, comparisons with Census data and prior population studies for the demographic and headache characteristics of the current sample suggest that findings are generalizable to the population of people with migraine. Women had more MHDs than men, and they were more likely to report migraine-related disability and cutaneous allodynia. The lifetime consultation rate for headache was relatively high, but many with migraine symptoms reported never having received a diagnosis of migraine from a healthcare professional. Acute prescription and preventive migraine treatments are underused. Migraine persists as an underdiagnosed and undertreated public health problem in 2018, and there are many opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with this painful, disabling condition.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The PRESTO study of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS; gammaCore®) featured key primary and secondary end points recommended by the International Headache Society to provide Class I evidence that for patients with an episodic migraine, nVNS significantly increases the probability of having mild pain or being pain-free 2 h post stimulation. Here, we examined additional data from PRESTO to provide further insights into the practical utility of nVNS by evaluating its ability to consistently deliver clinically meaningful improvements in pain intensity while reducing the need for rescue medication.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients recorded pain intensity for treated migraine attacks on a 4-point scale. Data were examined to compare nVNS and sham with regard to the percentage of patients who benefited by at least 1 point in pain intensity. We also assessed the percentage of attacks that required rescue medication and pain-free rates stratified by pain intensity at treatment initiation.\n",
      "RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of patients who used acute nVNS treatment (n = 120) vs sham (n = 123) reported a ≥ 1-point decrease in pain intensity at 30 min (nVNS, 32.2%; sham, 18.5%; P = 0.020), 60 min (nVNS, 38.8%; sham, 24.0%; P = 0.017), and 120 min (nVNS, 46.8%; sham, 26.2%; P = 0.002) after the first attack. Similar significant results were seen when assessing the benefit in all attacks. The proportion of patients who did not require rescue medication was significantly higher with nVNS than with sham for the first attack (nVNS, 59.3%; sham, 41.9%; P = 0.013) and all attacks (nVNS, 52.3%; sham, 37.3%; P = 0.008). When initial pain intensity was mild, the percentage of patients with no pain after treatment was significantly higher with nVNS than with sham at 60 min (all attacks: nVNS, 37.0%; sham, 21.2%; P = 0.025) and 120 min (first attack: nVNS, 50.0%; sham, 25.0%; P = 0.018; all attacks: nVNS, 46.7%; sham, 30.1%; P = 0.037).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrated that acute nVNS treatment quickly and consistently reduced pain intensity while decreasing rescue medication use. These clinical benefits provide guidance in the optimal use of nVNS in everyday practice, which can potentially reduce use of acute pharmacologic medications and their associated adverse events.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine headache without aura is the most common type of migraine especially among pediatric patients. It has always been a great challenge of migraine diagnosis using quantitative electroencephalography measurements through feature classification. It has been proven that different feature extraction and classification methods vary in terms of performance regarding detection and diagnostic accuracy. Previous work on the subject was controversial, hence a comparison of these methods seems necessary.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to compare two parametric and non-parametric feature extraction methods and also two classification methods in order to obtain optimal combinations of diagnostic accuracy.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Having recorded background EEG from 24 pediatric migraineurs and 19 control subjects, data was processed by Welch's and Yule-Walker's methods. Features were selected using genetic algorithm, and then given to a support vector machine and the linear discriminant analysis for the classification. Accuracy was calculated for all combinations having the dominant frequency and the correlated absolute power of each EEG wave band (theta, alpha, and beta) and for all wave bands combined.\n",
      "RESULTS: The highest migraine detection accuracy of 93% was obtained utilizing Welch's method for EEG feature extraction alongside support vector machine for a classifier. Besides, Yule-Walker autoregressive method showed better performance than Welch's, when only power bands (and not the dominant frequency) were used as classification input.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The superiority of Welch's method over Yule-Walker's and the support vector machine over linear discriminant analysis can be great help for further researches on computer aided EEG-based diagnosis of migraine.\n",

      "MATERIALS & METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 198 children 6-12 yr old in three groups were enrolled from Aug 2015 to Mar 2016. Migraine and tension headache groups from the Outpatient Clinic of Imam Khomeini of Hamadan, western Iran and healthy group from elementary schools were randomly selected (66 children in each group).

The data were analyzed using SPSS by descriptive statistic and multivariate ANOVA, one way ANOVA, Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and linear regression tests.\n",
      "RESULTS: Approximately, 45.5% of children with migraine and 37.9% of them with tension headache had experienced severe headache. Only a significant relationship was seen between mean scores of headache intensity and sleep quality in migraine group (P&lt;0.05). There was a significant difference in mean scores of sleep quality among three groups (P&lt;0.001).\n",

      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the usability and patient-rated experiences of an autoinjector with a prefilled syringe in patients with migraine, who self-administered galcanezumab, and to compare pharmacokinetic parameters between these devices.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-rated experiences with an investigational autoinjector and a prefilled syringe were compared in an open-label, 12-month study of once-monthly injections of galcanezumab 120 or 240 mg (NCT02614287). Patient-rated ease of usability was assessed with the Subcutaneous Administration Assessment Questionnaire (SQAAQ) and compared between devices. Positive responses on the SQAAQ were rated as \"agree or strongly agree\" to 12 statements. Tolerability was assessed by the frequency of injection-site-related adverse events (AEs) by device and injection location. In a separate study, galcanezumab pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects was compared between the devices (NCT02836613).\n",
      "RESULTS: In the open-label clinical trial, 179 patients used both the prefilled syringe and autoinjector at least once. The majority of patients (91%-97%) had positive responses on the SQAAQ to the use of autoinjector across the items assessed. There were 23 injection-site-related AEs with the first self-administered injection with the prefilled syringe (N=7) or autoinjector (N=16; P=0.061), with the most common AE for either device being injection-site pain. There were no significant between-device differences in injection-site-related AEs. For pharmacokinetics, the 90% CI for the ratio (autoinjector/prefilled syringe) of geometric least-square means for the galcanezumab area under the curve (AUC) concentration and maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was between 0.8 and 1.25, indicating no statistically significant difference in the galcanezumab concentrations regardless of the device used.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The ease of usability with either device was comparable, and there were no significant differences in tolerability between the prefilled syringe and autoinjector with the first self-administration; however, the analysis was not powered to detect a clinically significant difference. Galcanezumab pharmacokinetics were comparable between devices.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: About one in ten diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) has experienced a premorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI), while not fulfilling the criteria of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (BD due to TBI). We investigated whether these patients have similar clinical characteristics as previously described in BD due to TBI (i.e. more aggression and irritability and an increased hypomania/mania:depression ratio) and other distinct clinical characteristics.\n",
      "METHODS: Five hundred five patients diagnosed with BD type I, type II, or not otherwise specified, or cyclothymia were interviewed about family, medical, and psychiatric history, and assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Clinician Rated 30 (IDS-C<sub>30</sub>). Principal component analyses of YMRS and IDS-C<sub>30</sub> were conducted. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to compare clinical characteristics between patients with (n = 37) and without (n = 468) premorbid TBI.\n",
      "RESULTS: Premorbid TBI was associated with a higher YMRS disruptive component score (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, p = 0.0077) and more comorbid migraine (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.9-11, p = 0.00090) independently of several possible confounders. Items on disruptive/aggressive behaviour and irritability had the highest loadings on the YMRS disruptive component. Premorbid TBI was not associated with an increased hypomania/mania:depression ratio.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Telemedicine carries the potential of providing healthcare for individuals with limited access to clinics. While in some subspecialties telemedicine has been proved to be effective, its efficacy for replacing standard visits in complex subspecialties, such as pediatric neurology, has not been studied.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To determine compliance and adherence to follow-up and medication prescription for online pediatric neurology clinics.\n",
      "METHODS: We reviewed clinical records for follow-up and prescription requests of medication prescribed for children visiting the Maccabi Online Neuropediatric clinic in Ariel.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 78 children (aged 10.9±3.2 years; 40 girls, 38 boys) visited the online neuropediatric clinic between October 2015 and November 2017; 78 first visits, 44 follow-up visits. The first visit lasted 50 minutes including technical time. The main diagnoses were ADD/ADHD (41/78, 53%), followed by behavioral/emotional issues (11/78, 14%), headaches/migraines (9/78, 12%), learning disabilities (8/78, 10%) epilepsy (4/78, 5%) and others (5/78, 6%). Follow-up was recommended in most cases (48/78, 62%) mainly for ADD/ADHD and headaches/migraines. Most patients complied with follow-up (55%) with better rates among ADD/ADHD (19/29, 66%). Only a few patients (3/78,4%) continued follow-up in a regular clinic. Medication was recommended for 29/41 (71%) children with ADD/ADHD; all of whom requested medication prescription from the pediatrician (as it could not be prescribed digitally). Adherence was high as most patients (24/29, 83%) continued to request medication prescription.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: While adherence and compliance rates are high in tele-neurology clinics, especially for ADHD, further controlled studies are needed to compare services to regular visits and to assess the additional benefits of specialists healthcare delivery to underserved populations.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Most persistent posttraumatic headaches (PPTH) have a phenotype that meets diagnostic criteria for migraine or probable migraine. Although symptoms of autonomic dysfunction have been well described among those with migraine, the presence and relative severity of such symptoms among those with PPTH have yet to be reported.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess and compare symptoms of autonomic dysfunction among those with PPTH attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) vs migraine vs healthy controls using Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS-31) questionnaire scores.\n",
      "METHODS: Individuals with PPTH (n = 56) (87.5% of whom had a migraine/probable migraine phenotype), migraine (n = 30), and healthy controls (n = 36) were prospectively assessed in this cross-sectional cohort study using the COMPASS-31 questionnaire. Total COMPASS-31 scores and individual domain scores (bladder, gastrointestinal, orthostatic intolerance, pupillomotor, secretomotor, vasomotor) were compared between subject groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: COMPASS-31 mean total weighted score was 37.22 ± 15.44 in the PPTH group, 27.15 ± 14.37 in the migraine group, and 11.67 ± 8.98 for healthy controls. COMPASS-31 mean weighted total scores were significantly higher in those with PPTH vs migraine (P = .014), for PPTH vs healthy controls (P = .001), and for migraine vs healthy controls (P = .001). Those with PPTH had numerically higher scores for all COMPASS-31 domains compared to those with migraine, and the domain scores were significantly higher for orthostatic intolerance (PPTH = 4.80 ± 2.47 vs migraine = 3.33 ± 2.31, P = .027) and bladder (PPTH = 1.14 ± 1.45 vs migraine = 0.47 ± 0.73, P = .020). Among individuals with PPTH, post hoc correlations indicated a positive association between number of total lifetime TBIs with total weighted COMPASS-31 scores (rho = 0.32, P = .020), between years lived with headache and vasomotor domain subscores (rho = 0.27; P = .044), and between headache frequency with vasomotor domain subscores (rho = 0.27; P = .041).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction were greatest among those with PPTH compared to migraine and healthy controls. Among individuals with PPTH, number of lifetime TBIs was associated with greater symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, while greater headache burden was associated with higher vasomotor domain autonomic dysfunction subscores, potentially indicating that PPTH patients with higher disease burden have an increased risk for having autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction should be ascertained during the clinical management of patients with PPTH and might be a characteristic that helps differentiate PPTH from migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Certain headache characteristics and associated symptoms are commonly attributed to increased intracranial pressure, but they have not been systematically studied among children in the context of revised diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS).\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients treated for suspected or confirmed PTCS. Charts were reviewed for PTCS and headache diagnostic criteria and associated characteristics. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the frequency of headache characteristics between groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven individuals were identified: 61 had definite PTCS, 10 had probable PTCS, 31 had elevated opening pressure (OP) without papilledema, and 25 had normal OP without papilledema. Eleven children had no headache (6 with definite PTCS, 5 with probable PTCS). Headache pattern was episodic in 49% (95% CI: 34-64%) of those with definite PTCS, 18% (95% CI 6-37%) of those with elevated OP without papilledema, and 16% (5-36%) of those with normal OP without papilledema. Headache location was more likely to involve the head along with neck or shoulders in those with definite PTCS compared with elevated OP without papilledema (OR = 7.2, 95% CI: 1.9-27.6) and normal OP (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.3-15.6) groups.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: While missing data and small cohort size are limitations, this study suggests that headache in PTCS is more likely to involve the head along with neck/shoulders, and that headache in PTCS may be episodic or constant. Headache is occasionally absent in PTCS.\n",

      "MATERIAL-METHOD: The study consisted of 32 VM patients, 32 migraineurs and 31 healthy subjects with similar sex and age. Balance functions were assessed with Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BEST), dizziness and headache severity with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), disability related to dizziness with Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), cognition with Stroop test.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was no statistical significant difference among the three groups in terms of age, gender, height, weight, marital status and education levels (p>0.05). Headache severity was higher in migraineurs than vestibular migraineurs and healthy subjects, also dizziness severity was higher in vestibular migraineurs than migraineurs and healthy subjects (p<0.0167). The outcomes of BEST 4, 5, 6 and BEST-total were significantly impaired in VM patients than migraineurs and healthy subjects, and worse in migraineurs rather than healthy subjects (p<0.0167). Stroop effect of cognitive examination was worse in VM and migraine patients rather than healthy subjects (p<0.0167). There was no significantly difference between VM and migraineurs (p>0.0167). There was a negative correlation between Stroop effect and BEST-total in VM patients significantly (r=-0.509, p=0.003), and no significant correlation in migraineurs (p>0.05). Disability levels of VM patients were low in 38.7%, mild in 51.6% and severe in 9.7% related to DHI. There was no significant difference between balance and cognition function in terms of disability levels (p>0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The balance and cognition in VM patients and migraineurs were impaired rather than healthy subjects. The patient groups differed from each other in terms of vertiginous complaints rather than cognition. Solving the functional limitations with further longitudinal examinations can facilitate the treatment. The appropriate physiotherapy programs and patient education methods can be planned for these various issues.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare comprehensive measures of scalp-recorded muscle activity in migraineurs and controls.\n",
      "METHOD: We used whole-of-head high-density scalp electrical recordings, independent component analysis (ICA) and spectral slope of the derived components, to define muscle (electromyogram-containing) components. After projecting muscle components back to scalp, we quantified scalp spectral power in the frequency range, 52-98 Hz, reflecting muscle activation. We compared healthy subjects (n = 65) and migraineurs during a non-headache period (n = 26). We also examined effects due to migraine severity, gender, scalp-region and task (eyes-closed and eyes-open). We could not examine the effect of pre-ictal versus inter-ictal versus post-ictal as this information was not available in the pre-existing dataset.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was more power due to muscle activity (mean ± SEM) in migraineurs than controls (respectively, -13.61 ± 0.44 dB versus -14.73 ± 0.24 dB, p = 0.028). Linear regression showed no relationship between headache frequency and muscle activity in any combination of region and task. There was more power during eyes-open than eyes-closed (respectively, -13.42 ± 0.34 dB versus -14.92 ± 0.34 dB, p = 0.002).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: There is an increase in cranial and upper cervical muscle activity in non-ictal migraineurs versus controls. This raises questions of the role of muscle in migraine, and the possible differentiation of non-ictal phases.\n",
      "SIGNIFICANCE: This provides preliminary evidence to date of possible cranial muscle involvement in migraine.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To better understand the utility of using pain freedom and most bothersome headache-associated symptom (MBS) freedom as co-primary endpoints in clinical trials of acute migraine interventions.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Adhesive dermally applied microarray (ADAM) is an investigational system for intracutaneous drug administration. The recently completed pivotal Phase 2b/3 study (ZOTRIP), evaluating ADAM zolmitriptan for the treatment of acute moderate to severe migraine, was one of the first large studies to incorporate MBS freedom and pain freedom as co-primary endpoints per recently issued guidance by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this trial, the proportion of patients treated with ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg, who were pain-free and MBS-free at 2 hours post-dose, was significantly higher than for placebo.\n",
      "METHODS: We undertook a post-hoc analysis of data from the ZOTRIP trial to examine how the outcomes from this trial compare to what might have been achieved using the conventional co-primary endpoints of pain relief, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 159 patients treated with ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg or placebo, prospectively designated MBS were photophobia (n = 79), phonophobia (n = 43), and nausea (n = 37). Two-hour pain free rates in those with photophobia as the MBS were 36% for ADAM zolmitriptan 3.8 mg and 14% for placebo (P = .02). Corresponding rates for those with phonophobia as the MBS were 14% and 41% (P = .05). For those whose MBS was nausea, corresponding values were 56% and 16%, respectively (P = .01). Two-hour freedom from the MBS for active drug vs placebo were 67% vs 35% (P < .01) for photophobia, 55% vs 43% (P = .45) for phonophobia, and 89% vs 58% for nausea (P = .04). MBS freedom but not pain freedom was achieved in 28%. Only 1 patient (1%) achieved pain freedom, but not MBS freedom. The proportion with both pain and MBS freedom was highest (56%) among those whose MBS was nausea.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In this study, the use of MBS was feasible and seemed to compare favorably to the previously required 4 co-primary endpoints.\n",

They completed an anonymous questionnaire with demographic, lifestyle, medical data, presence of recurrent headaches and its features, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. We defined probable migraine if headache presented ≥ 3 ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine. An analysis was performed to evaluate headache characteristics and compare lifestyles between those with or without headache.\n",
      "RESULTS: 1619 out of 1873 students completed the survey (response rate 86.4%). From these, 30.5% suffered from recurrent headache and 11.3% had migraine features; 32.9% of adolescents with headache had at least one episode per week and 44.1% showed some degree of headache-related disability measured by the PedMIDAS scale. In a univariate analysis, headache was significantly more frequent in girls (35.1% vs. 25.5%, p < 0.001), teenagers with poor sleeping habits (36.6% vs. 27.6%, p < 0.001), lower physical activity ( p = 0.002), those who did not have breakfast (37.3 vs. 28.4%, p = 0.001), smokers (10.5% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001) and caffeine overusers (30.9% vs. 24.7%, p = 0.009).

      "RESULTS: Forty one girls (51.3%) and 39 boys (48.7%) with mean age of 10.44±2.26 yr were evaluated. Good response was seen in 82.5% of amitriptyline and 62%.5 of melatonin groups and amitriptyline was statistically significant more effective (P=0.04). Severity, duration and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment score (PedMIDAS) of headache reduced with melatonin from 6.05±1.63 to 4.03±1.54 scores, from 2.06±1.18 to 1.41± 0.41 hours, and from 33.13±9.17 to 23.38±9.51 scores, respectively. Severity, duration and PedMIDAS of headache decreased with amitriptyline from 6.41±1.67to 2.25±1.21, from 2.55 ±1.85to 0.56±0.51h, and from 31.4±9.33 to 8.28 ± 3.75, respectively (All P &lt; 0.05). Both drugs were effective in reduction of monthly frequency, severity, duration and disability of headache. Daily sleepiness was seen in 7.5% of melatonin group as a side effect and adverse events were seen in 22.5% of amitriptyline group including daily sleepiness in four, constipation in three and fatigue in two children and melatonin was safer than amitriptyline (value = 0.04).\n",

Higher percentage of patients was completely free of the headache two hours after dose administration in the ergotamine-based medication group compared to the sumatriptan group, regardless whether all (51.12 % vs 33.70 %) or only repeated attacks were taken into account (50.91 % vs 23.73 %); the salvage therapy (diclofenac) utilization rate was also lower in the ergotamine-based medication group (relative risk 0.61). Photophobia, phonophobia, and osmophobia were reversed more frequently in the ergotamine-based medication group (51.12 % vs 33.70 %), and failure to abort an attack of the migraine without aura occurred more frequently in the group treated with sumatriptan (1.1 % vs 4.9 %). The headache intensity two hours after ingestion of the study medication increased more frequently with sumatriptan, while other adverse events were rare in both groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated higher efficacy and similar safety of ergotamine based fixed drug combination in comparison to sumatriptan, when used in the treatment of an acute attack of the migraine. HIPPOKRATIA 2018, 22(1): 17-22.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: 1) Describe publishing trends for otologic/neurotologic disorders over a 35-year span. 2) Compare trends in publishing with disease prevalence. 3) Evaluate changes in topic and journal specific ranking scores over time.\n",
      "METHODS: PubMed searches were performed on 35 otologic/neurotologic disorders using medical subject headings (MeSH) terms from 1980 to 2015. Searches were limited in scope to the English language. A Mann-Kendall trend analysis evaluated changes in publication frequency as a discrete variable while correcting for total number of articles published per year. Scopus was used to identify SCImago Country and Journal Rank (SJR) indicator scores and weighted-averages used to calculate changes over time.\n",
      "RESULTS: The total number of publications on the 35 topics increased from 853 in 1980 to a peak of 3,068 in 2013. Otitis media (τ = -0.799, p < 0.001) and Menière's disease (τ = -0.724, p < 0.001) showed strong decreasing publication trends. Temporal bone encephaloceles (τ = 0.743, p < 0.001) and cochlear implants (τ = 0.740, p < 0.001) showed strong increasing publication trends. Rapid rise in publications on superior canal dehiscence and vestibular migraine illustrate novel diagnoses. The weighted-average SJR score increased from 0.816 in 2000 to 1.160 in 2015 (p < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study displays trends in the literature over the past 35 years that are often inconsistent with common disorders seen by otologists/neurotologists. Certain diagnoses that are currently being researched less commonly continue to impact patients with the same regularity. Quality of otologic/neurotologic literature has become more reputable with regards to SJR scores.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in patients with a diagnosis of migraine, who insist on the performance of imaging, is of more benefit in detecting clinically significant unsuspected structural abnormalities than would be expected by chance.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective, observational, single-center study was performed from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012 and included 100 subjects with a diagnosis of migraine and normal results on neurologic examination. A brain MRI scan was performed on all patients, solely at their request, to detect an unsuspected clinically significant structural lesion.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 100 patients, 86 were female, and the average age was 31.5 years. Forty-five patients experienced migraine without aura, 41 chronic migraine, and 14 migraine with aura. All of the patients had normal results on neurologic examination. The duration of headaches ranged from 4 months to 40 years. In all, 82 of the MRI scans showed normal results, and 17 revealed clinically insignificant abnormalities. One MRI in a patient with chronic migraine without aura revealed a meningioma that subsequently required surgery and radiation therapy. The 1% prevalence of tumor in this study was then compared with 2 large cohorts of MRI abnormalities in the general asymptomatic population, in which tumor was found in 35 out of 3000. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the prevalence of tumor in the study population with the combined cohorts, and there was no statistical difference between these rates (P > .99).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Brain MRI obtained at the specific request of patients with a diagnosis of migraine in the presence of normal neurologic examination results has a yield that is equivalent to that of the general asymptomatic population. Patients do not seem to have more insight than the examining clinician with regard to detecting underlying structural abnormalities, and brain MRI should not performed as part of the routine evaluation of migraine without a clear clinical indication.\n",

      "METHODS: Nineteen asymptomatic MA and MO patients and 11 age and sex matched controls (C) were recorded by 65 EEG channels. The same visual stimulation was employed to evaluate BOLD signal changes in a subgroup of MA and MO. The GC and brain networking were applied to EEG signals.\n",
      "RESULTS: A different pattern of reduced vs increased GC respectively in MO and MA patients, emerged in resting state. During visual stimulation, both MA and MO showed increased information transfer toward the fronto-central regions, while MA patients showed a segregated cluster of connections in the posterior regions, and an increased bold signal in the visual cortex, more evident at 2 cpd spatial frequency.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common type of headache. Sometimes adequate pain relief is not achieved by conventional treatments. Acupuncture and botulinum toxin-A injection are known as non-pharmacological interventions for this purpose. The aim of this research was to compare the effect of acupuncture with botulinum toxin-A injection and pharmacological treatment in controlling chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on patients with chronic migraine in the North of Iran during 2014-2015. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to groups receiving acupuncture (A) or botulinum toxin A (B) and controls (C) by designed quadripartite blocks. All patients were evaluated at baseline, one, two and three months after treatment using visual analogue scale (VAS) score and other parameters. The analysis of data was performed in SPSS software Version 19.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients (48 males and 102 females) completed this study. During the 3- month study, the pain severity significantly diminished in three groups (P=0.0001), with greater reduction in group A (P=0.0001). The number of days per month with migraine, absence from work and the need for medication significantly decreased in three groups at 3 times of evaluation (p<0.05) with fewer side effects in group A (P=0.021).\n",

      "METHODS: Health claims data from a large statutory health insurance company were analysed from both the societal perspective (primary outcome) and from the statutory health insurance perspective (secondary outcome). To compare costs between patient groups, homeopathy and control patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores. Predictor variables for the propensity scores included health care costs and both medical and demographic variables. Health care costs were analysed using an analysis of covariance, adjusted for baseline costs, between groups both across diagnoses and for specific diagnoses over a period of 33 months. Specific diagnoses included depression, migraine, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and headache.\n",
      "RESULTS: Data from 21,939 patients in the homeopathy group (67.4% females) and 21,861 patients in the control group (67.2% females) were analysed. Health care costs over the 33 months were 12,414 EUR [95% CI 12,022-12,805] in the homeopathy group and 10,428 EUR [95% CI 10,036-10,820] in the control group (p<0.0001). The largest cost differences were attributed to productivity losses (homeopathy: EUR 6,289 [6,118-6,460]; control: EUR 5,498 [5,326-5,670], p<0.0001) and outpatient costs (homeopathy: EUR 1,794 [1,770-1,818]; control: EUR 1,438 [1,414-1,462], p<0.0001). Although the costs of the two groups converged over time, cost differences remained over the full 33 months. For all diagnoses, homeopathy patients generated higher costs than control patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The analysis showed that even when following-up over 33 months, there were still cost differences between groups, with higher costs in the homeopathy group.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary approaches have been proposed for migraine management. A nursing intervention could improve patient outcomes.\n",
      "METHODS: We prospectively studied new patients referred to our tertiary headache center for migraine. The control group was followed by a physician; the active group was also followed by a nurse with a personalized intervention including adaptation of the lifestyle.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two hundred patients (176 women and 24 men, mean age 40 years old) were included and classified according to headache frequency. Each group was followed for 12 months with daily headache diaries. One hundred and sixty-two completed the study. There were no significant differences between groups for the decrease in headache days, the percent of chronic patients reverting to episodic status or the cessation of medication overuse. Patients in the control group were more likely to find a successful prophylaxis (55.6 vs 27.7%, P = .002). Despite this, the mean decrease in HIT-6 scores at month 8 was 5.23 ± 9.18 for the active group compared with a decrease of 2.10 ± 9.27 for the control group (P = .030, clinically significant difference of 3.13).

      "OBJECTIVE: Low-cost evidence-based tools are needed to facilitate the early identification of patients with possible psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Prior to accurate diagnosis, patients with PNES do not receive interventions that address the cause of their seizures and therefore incur high medical costs and disability due to an uncontrolled seizure disorder. Both seizures and comorbidities may contribute to this high cost.\n",
      "METHODS: Based on data from 1,365 adult patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed diagnoses from a single center, we used logistic and Poisson regression to compare the total number of comorbidities, number of medications, and presence of specific comorbidities in five mutually exclusive groups of diagnoses: epileptic seizures (ES) only, PNES only, mixed PNES and ES, physiologic nonepileptic seizurelike events, and inconclusive monitoring. To determine the diagnostic utility of comorbid diagnoses and medication history to differentiate PNES only from ES only, we used multivariate logistic regression, controlling for sex and age, trained using a retrospective database and validated using a prospective database.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our model differentiated PNES only from ES only with a prospective accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval =72-84%) and area under the curve of 79%. With a few exceptions, the number of comorbidities and medications was more predictive than a specific comorbidity. Comorbidities associated with PNES were asthma, chronic pain, and migraines (p < 0.01). Comorbidities associated with ES were diabetes mellitus and nonmetastatic neoplasm (p < 0.01). The population-level analysis suggested that patients with mixed PNES and ES may be a population distinct from patients with either condition alone.\n",
      "SIGNIFICANCE: An accurate patient-reported medical history and medication history can be useful when screening for possible PNES. Our prospectively validated and objective score may assist in the interpretation of the medication and medical history in the context of the seizure description and history.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Fast relief of migraine pain, associated symptoms, and migraine-related disability are priorities in the acute treatment of migraine. Efforts to improve the pharmacokinetic profiles of acute migraine treatments with the aim of providing faster relief include the development of non-oral routes of administration. AVP-825 (ONZETRA® Xsail® ) is a delivery system containing 22 mg sumatriptan powder that uses a patient's own breath to deliver medication intranasally, targeting the upper posterior nasal cavity beyond the narrow nasal valve, an area lined with vascular mucosa conducive to rapid drug absorption into the systemic circulation. While most studies comparing treatments measure differences in proportions of patients achieving a dichotomous endpoint at fixed time intervals, in this study we compare trajectories of migraine pain and disability over time for AVP-825 versus 100 mg oral sumatriptan tablets.\n",
      "METHODS: We used data from the COMPASS study (NCT01667679, clinicaltrials.gov), a double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, cross-over study of people with a diagnosis of migraine. Participants treated up to five qualifying migraine attacks within 1 hour of onset with either AVP-825 plus placebo tablets or 100 mg oral sumatriptan tablets plus placebo delivery system during the first of two 12-week treatment periods, and then switched treatment sequences to treat up to five more attacks in the second treatment period. Patients recorded ordinal migraine pain intensity and migraine-related disability before dosing (predose), and at 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Three-level ordinal multilevel models accounted for unique data structure (repeated measures nested within attacks for each patient) and tested for treatment differences in migraine pain and migraine-related disability through the first 2 hours of attacks post dose.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 259 study participants (mean age 40.0 years, 84.6% female, 78.4% white), there was significant between and within person variability in migraine pain intensity and migraine-related disability. A typical individual showed significantly faster reductions in migraine pain over the first 30 minutes and migraine-related disability over the first 45 minutes when treating with AVP-825 compared with oral sumatriptan. Overall levels of pain and disability also favored AVP-825 over 2 h following treatment. Model-based odds ratios (OR) comparing AVP-825 to oral sumatriptan ranged from 0.38 to 0.76 for pain and 0.37 to 0.65 for disability, with OR <1 indicating reduced pain/disability in the AVP-825 condition.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 100 mg oral sumatriptan, treatment with AVP-825 was associated with faster reductions in migraine pain intensity and migraine-related disability starting at 10 minutes postdose and continuing through the first 30 minutes for migraine pain intensity and the first 45 minutes for migraine-related disability, resulting in lower overall pain intensity and disability that lasted through the first 2 h following treatment. Both migraine pain intensity and disability varied substantially both across subjects and within subjects across attacks.\n",

The aim of the present study was to compare between males and females, demographic and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with migraines diagnosed according to the ICDIII-beta version.\n",
      "METHODS: The electronic database of a tertiary pediatric headache clinic was searched for all children and adolescents diagnosed with migraine headaches in 2010-2016. Data on demographics, symptoms, and headache-related parameters were collected from the medical files. Findings were compared by gender.\n",
      "RESULTS: The cohort included 468 children and adolescents of mean age 11.3 ± 3.6 years; 215 males (45.9%) and 253 females (54.1%). Migraine without aura was documented in 313 patients (66.9%), and migraine with aura in 127 (27.1%); 28 patients (6.0%) had probable migraines. The female patients had significantly higher values than the male patients for the following parameters: age at admission (p = 0.042, Cohen's d 0.8303, 95% CI 0.614-0.992); age at migraine onset (p = 0.021, Cohen's d 0.211, 95% CI 0.029-0.394); rate of migraine with aura (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.29-3.16, p = 0.0056); headache frequency (p = 0.0149, Cohen's d 0.211, 95% CI 0.029-0.3940); rate of chronic migraine (p = 0.036, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02-2.34); and puberty (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.01-6.35, p = <0.001). Males had a higher rate of vomiting (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93, p = 0.018). Further analysis by pubertal stage revealed that pubertal females, but not prepubertal females, had a significantly higher rate of migraine with aura than did males (41.1% versus 28.9%; OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.85-2.37, p = 0.039).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Female children and adolescents with migraine treated in a tertiary pediatric headache clinic were characterized by a higher rate of chronic migraine and migraine with aura, a lower rate of vomiting, and older age at onset relative to males. These findings might be influenced by the better description of migraine symptoms by females owing to their better verbal ability.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: COX-2 inhibitors can be effective for acute migraine, but none is supplied in a rapidly absorbed, ready-to-use oral liquid formulation. DFN-15, a novel oral liquid formulation of celecoxib, is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. Clinical studies with this formulation are ongoing.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were to compare the bioavailability of DFN-15 with that of the commercial formulation of celecoxib 400-mg oral capsules (Celebrex®) and to determine the dose proportionality of DFN-15 in healthy fasted volunteers.\n",
      "METHODS: This single-dose randomized crossover study in 16 healthy fasted volunteers evaluated the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of DFN-15 at doses of 120, 180, and 240 mg against the commercial formulation of celecoxib 400-mg oral capsules and determined the dose proportionality of DFN-15.\n",
      "RESULTS: The maximum observed plasma concentrations (C <sub>max</sub>) of celecoxib after the administration of DFN-15 120, 180, and 240 mg (1062-1933 ng/ml) were higher than for the 400-mg oral capsules (611 ng/ml). The median time to peak concentration (T <sub>max</sub>) was within 1 h for DFN-15 and 2.5 h for the oral capsules. The pharmacokinetics of DFN-15 were dose proportional from 120 to 240 mg. Partial area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) from 15 min to 2 h for DFN-15 120 mg were at least threefold higher than for the oral capsules, and the relative bioavailability of DFN-15 was approximately 140% that of the oral capsules. DFN-15 was well tolerated, with no new or unexpected adverse events.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Based on a faster rate of absorption and increased bioavailability, DFN-15 is being evaluated as an abortive medication for acute treatment in patients with migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been questioned in migraine, but BBB permeability has never been investigated during spontaneous migraine attacks. In the present study, BBB permeability during spontaneous attacks of migraine without aura was investigated compared to an interictal state.\n",
      "METHODS: Seventy-four patients suffering from migraine without aura were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) study. The patients were instructed to report at the hospital for DCE-MRI scan during and outside of a spontaneous migraine attack. The primary end-point was a difference in the BBB permeability (ml/100 g/min) between the attack and the headache-free days. The permeability was assessed in five different regions of interest (ROIs) located in the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral area, brain stem, posterior pons and whole brain. The paired samples t test was used to compare K<sub>i</sub> (permeability) values between the attack and headache-free days.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nineteen patients completed the study. Median time from onset of migraine attack to scan was 6.5 h (range 4.0-15.5 h). No change in the mean BBB permeability (ml/100 g/min) was found between the attack and the headache-free days in any of the measured ROIs. No relationship between the pain side or intensity and BBB permeability was found in 15 patients with unilateral pain during the examined attack.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the BBB permeability during spontaneous migraine attacks without aura was unchanged.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ménière's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear typically showing recurrent acute episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Epidemiologic studies on MD are scarce. We assessed the incidence rates (IRs) of MD and describe the characteristics of MD cases, comparing them to control patients without recorded evidence of MD.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective population-based follow-up study and a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink.\n",
      "METHODS: We identified patients between 18 and 79 years of age with an incident MD diagnosis between January 1993 and December 2014. We assessed the IRs of betahistine-treated MD. In the nested case-control analysis, we matched 4 controls to each MD case on sex, age, general practice, years of active history in the database, and calendar time. We conducted a χ2 test to present p values in order to compare the prevalence of demographics, comorbidities, and co-medication between cases and controls.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 5,508 MD cases and 22,032 MD-free controls (65.4% females). The overall IR for MD in the UK was 13.1 per 100,000 person-years. More cases were female, and the mean age at diagnosis was 55.4 ± 13.7 years. Smoking and alcohol consumption were less prevalent among MD cases. Depression, other affective disorders, sleeping disorders, anxiety, and migraine were more prevalent among MD cases than among controls.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: MD is uncommon in primary care in the UK with a preponderance among females.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Topiramate is a medication that is approved as both monotherapy and adjunctive treatment of seizure disorder in adults and adolescents. It is also approved for migraine prophylaxis. It has been associated with many side effects, including weight loss and the development of renal stones. It has also been associated with various central nervous system side effects such as dizziness, nervousness, parasthesias, and fatigue. Less commonly, it has been associated with the development of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between the administration of topiramate and the development of hallucinations in this patient.\n",
      "METHODS: We will now present the case of a 32-year-old man who developed auditory hallucinations after initiating a relatively low dose of topiramate (25mg twice daily) for the treatment of chronic pain. We will review the prior cases of topiramate induced hallucinations, and discuss how these cases compare to the case we have described. We will review the treatment of these hallucinations.\n",
      "RESULTS: In this case, there was a close temporal relationship between the initiation of topiramate and the onset of auditory hallucinations.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This case supports the previous reports describing the association between the use of topiramate and the developmenrt of hallucinations. Although the average daily topiramate dose associated with the development of hallucinations in previously reported cases was 150 mg in women and 181 mg in men, hallucinations can occur at lower doses (as low as 50 mg daily) as well.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that substantial weight loss through bariatric surgery (BS) may result in short-term improvement of migraine severity. However, it still remains to be seen whether smaller amounts of weight loss have a similar effect on migraine headache. This study has been designed to compare the effects of weight reduction through BS and non-surgical modifications.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Migraine characteristics were assessed at 1 month before (T0), 1 month (T1), and 6 months (T2) after BS (vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) (n = 25) or behavioral therapy (BT) (n = 26) in obese women (aged 18-60 years) with migraine headache. Migraine was diagnosed using the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHDIIβ) criteria.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was significant reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) from the baseline to T1 and T2 in both groups. The number of migraine-free days showed a significant increase within each group (p < 0.001). The BS group had a significant reduction in attack duration (p < 0.001) while there were no changes observed within the BT group. Following the adjustment of ANCOVA models for baseline values of migraine characteristics, age, changes in weight, BMI, body fat, and fat-free mass from T0 to T2, the BS group showed statistically significant lower VAS and duration of migraine attacks and a significantly higher number of migraine-free days than the BT group at T1 and T2 (p ≤ 0.028).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that far before significant weight reduction after BS (VSG), there was marked alleviation in the severity and duration of migraine and a significant increase in the number of migraine-free days in obese female migraineurs. However, the effects in the BT group were not comparable with the effects in the BS group.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: One of the irritating features of migraine is emesis that can compromise taking oral medications. We designed this study to compare the effectiveness of granisetron and metoclopramide in reducing pain and treating emesis in migraine patients.\n",
      "METHODS: We included a total of 148 patients with migraine headache presenting to two referral hospitals in a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. We compared the effect of granisetron (2 mg intravenous) with metoclopramide (10 mg intravenous). Pain intensity and emesis episodes were recorded before drug administration, one, two and four 4 h after drug administration.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 148 patients, 47 were male and 101 were female. 75 patients received granisetron and 73 metoclopramide. Mean pain intensity before the administration of the medications was 7.67 ± 1.30 in granisetron group and 7.68 ± 1.13 in metoclopramide group with an insignificant difference. Mean pain intensity at one, two, and 4 h after drug administration was 3.20 ± 1.37, 2.39 ± 1.28, and 1.31 ± 0.52 in granisetron group and 5.04 ± 1.77, 4.1 ± 1.8, and 1.56 ± 0.68 in metoclopramide group (P = 0.03). Mean emesis episodes before drug administration were 1.85 ± 0.81 and 1.80 ± 0.77 in granisetron and metoclopramide groups, respectively. These episodes were 1.33 ± 0.66, 0.25 ± 0.49, and 0.04 ± 0.19 in granisetron group and 1.38 ± 0.73, 0.21 ± 0.47, and 0.41 ± 0.19 in metoclopramide group at one, two, and 4 h after the drug administration (P = 0.7).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: To came in conclusion, compared to metoclopramide, granisetron is a better choice in acute migraine ATTACK because it decreases the patients' pain as well as their emesis.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of intratympanic gentamicin injection (ITG) on vertigo control, drop attacks, and functional level in Menière's disease patients with and without a history of migraine.\n",
      "PATIENTS: Menière's disease patients (patients with migraine and age- and sex-matched control patients without migraine) treated from 2002 to 2012 who failed medical management and received ITG, with a minimum 2-year follow up.\n",
      "INTERVENTION: ITG.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vertigo control, drop attack prevalence, and change in functional level.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-eight Menière's disease patients were included in this study (14 with migraine and 14 matched patients without migraine). There were three men and 11 women in each groups, with a mean age of 53 ± 8.9 years. Baseline characteristics (Menière's stage, vertigo frequency, drop attack prevalence, and functional level) before ITG were not significantly different between the two groups. Two years after ITG, 71% of Menière's disease with migraine patients and 78% of Menière's disease without migraine patients had class A, B, or C vertigo control (p > 0.999). Change in prevalence of drop attacks (43-7% versus 50-0%, respectively) was also similar (p > 0.999). However, significantly fewer vertigo control class A, B, and C migraine patients achieved functional level 1 or 2 (40%) compared with non-migraine patients (91%) (p = 0.007).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although ITG appears equally effective in treating vertigo and drop attacks in Menière's disease with and without migraine, patients with migraine derive significantly less benefit in terms of functional improvement.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: Migraine is a suggested risk factor for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). An increased risk of aSAH in migraineurs may be explained by an increased prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). We performed a case-control study to compare lifetime migraine prevalence in patients with UIA, patients with a history of transient ischemic attact (TIA) or ischemic stroke and controls without a history of aSAH, TIA or ischemic stroke.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with UIA were recruited from two university hospitals. Data on patients with TIA/stroke were retrieved from a previous study. Partners of patients with UIA or TIA/stroke were included as controls. Migraine history was assessed via a telephone interview based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition criteria. We calculated odds ratios (OR) for migraine with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, hypertension and smoking.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 172 patients with UIA, 221 patients with TIA or stroke, and 164 controls. In UIA patients, migraine prevalence was 24.4% compared with 14.6% in controls (UIA vs. controls; OR 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.5) and 22.2% in TIA/stroke patients (UIA vs. TIA/stroke; OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.7-1.8). After adjustments, the OR for migraine in UIA patients versus controls were 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-3.1) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.0) versus TIA/stroke. Results were comparable for migraine with and without aura.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine prevalence is possibly increased in patients with UIA compared with controls and comparable with the prevalence in patients with TIA or stroke. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the underlying pathophysiology.\n",

      "RESULTS: Two thousand seventy-nine patients were assigned 2,468 diagnoses, of which 57.7 and 42.3% were of peripheral and nonperipheral etiologies, respectively. The most common diagnoses were Ménière's (23.0%), vestibular migraine (19.3%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (19.1%), and central origin, nonmigraine (16.4%). Peripheral diagnoses are more likely to be found in men than in women (odds ratio [OR] 1.59). Peripheral diagnoses were most likely to be found in the 60 to 69 age group (OR 3.82). There was not a significant difference in rate of vestibular testing between women and men. Among patients with two diagnoses, the most common combinations were vestibular migraine and BPPV then vestibular migraine and Ménière's.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing and magnitude of variation of pediatric readmission rates across race/ethnicity for selected chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, seizures, migraines, and depression.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of hospitalizations at 48 children's hospitals in the 2013 Pediatric Health Information System database for children (ages 0-18 years) admitted for asthma (n = 36 910), seizure (n = 35 361), diabetes (n = 12 468), migraine (n = 5882), and depression (n = 5132). Generalized linear models with a random effect for hospital were used to compare the likelihood of readmission by patients' race/ethnicity, adjusting for severity of illness, age, payer, and medical complexity. Adjusted readmission rates were calculated by week over 1 year.\n",
      "RESULTS: Significant variation in adjusted readmission rates by race/ethnicity existed for conditions aside from depression. Disparities for diabetes and asthma emerged at 3 and 4 weeks, respectively; they remained divergent up to 1 year with the highest 1-year readmission rates in non-Hispanic blacks vs other race/ethnicities (diabetes: 21.7% vs 13.4%, P < .001; asthma: 21.4% vs 14.6%, P < .001). Disparities for migraines and seizure emerged at 6 and 7 weeks, respectively; they remained up to 1 year, with the highest 1-year readmission rates in non-Hispanic whites vs other race/ethnicities (migraine: 17.3% vs 13.6%, P < .001; seizure: 23.9% vs 21.9%, P < .001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Readmission disparities behave differently across chronic conditions. They emerge more quickly after discharge for children hospitalized with asthma or diabetes than for seizures or migraines. The highest readmission rates were not consistently observed for 1 particular race/ethnicity. Study findings can impact pediatric chronic disease management to improve care for children with these conditions.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Vestibular rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for dizziness due to vestibular dysfunction. Given the biological relationship between vestibular symptoms and headache, headache in patients with vestibular migraine (VM) could be improved by vestibular rehabilitation that leads to the improvement of dizziness. This study aimed to compare the effects of vestibular rehabilitation on headache and other outcomes relating to dizziness, and the psychological factors in patients with VM patients, patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, and patients without headache.\n",
      "METHODS: Our participants included 251 patients with dizziness comprising 28 patients with VM, 79 patients with tension-type headache, and 144 patients without headache. Participants were hospitalized for 5 days and taught to conduct a vestibular rehabilitation program. They were assessed using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Somatosensory Catastrophizing Scale (SSCS) and underwent center of gravity fluctuation measurement as an objective dizziness severity index before, 1 month after, and 4 months after their hospitalization.\n",
      "RESULTS: The VM and tension-type headache groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the HIT-6 score with improvement of the DHI, HADS, SSCS, and a part of the objective dizziness index that also shown in patients without headache following vestibular rehabilitation. The change in HIT-6 during rehabilitation in the VM group was positively correlated with changes in the DHI and anxiety in the HADS. Changes in the HIT-6 in tension-type headache group positively correlated with changes in anxiety and SSCS.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Vestibular rehabilitation contributed to improvement of headache both in patients with VM and patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, in addition to improvement of dizziness and psychological factors. Improvement in dizziness following vestibular rehabilitation could be associated with the improvement of headache more prominently in VM compared with comorbid tension-type headache.\n",

There is a clear relationship between the menstruation cycle and the occurrence of migraine (menstrual migraine). Nowadays the treatment of menstrual (related) migraine is performed by a neurologist. A treatment with attention to hormonal treatment seems more convenient.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in a cohort using data of 88 women with menstrual (related) migraine who visited the menstrual migraine clinic between 2012 and 2014 (intervention group). The results were compared to a historical control group, which consisted of women with menstrual (related) migraine who were treated before 2012 and received a mono-disciplinary approach.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the intervention group the Headache Impact (HIT) score significantly improved (65 to 59 points). The mean headache days per month declined significantly (from 6 to 3.83 days) and these women needed less use of pain medication. In the control group the decline in HIT score was less striking (65 to 63.5 points) and the mean headache days per month increased (6 to 6,5 days). It appeared that 20 out of 27 patients in the control group required a gynaecological consultation in course of time.\n",

      "RESULTS: During a three-month follow-up, the mean of headache frequency, severity, and MIDAS score were changed significantly. The rate of decrease in headache frequency was higher in control group than intervention group ((6.7±2.7 and 14.4±5.3 day/month, respectively) (P<0.001). Also, headache severity and MIDAS score significantly decreased in the control group than intervention group (3.4±1.1 and 5.7±1.6, respectively P<0.001, 16.7 ± 6.1 and 30.2±9.8, respectively (P<0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, levetiracetam offered improvement in headache frequency, severity, and MIDAS score in patients with CM. However, levetiracetam was not effective enough for chronic migraine as valproate, despite some significant effect. Thus levetiracetam can be one of the choices for limited chronic migraine subjects who are in contraindication of Valproate.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Primary headaches include migraines, tension-type headaches and other primary headache syndromes. Migraines and tension-type headaches are associated with patient discomfort and other diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between primary headaches and the risk of developing dementia, and to clarify the association between different types of headaches and dementia.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide matched cohort population-based study. A total of 3,620 patients with newly diagnosed primary headaches, including migraines and tension-type headaches, between January 1 and December 31, 2000 were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, along with 10,860 controls matched for sex and age. After adjusting for confounding factors, Fine and Gray׳s competing risk analysis was used to compare the risk of developing dementia during 10 years of follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the study subjects, 170 (4.70 %) developed dementia compared with 433 (3.99%) of the controls. Fine and Gray׳s competing risk analysis revealed that the study subjects were more likely to develop dementia (hazard ratio = 2.057; 95% CI: 1.718-2.462; P < 0.001). After adjusting for sex, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region of residence and comorbidities, the hazard ratio for dementia was 2.048 (95% CI: 1.705-2.461, P < 0.001). Migraines and tension-type headaches were associated with nonvascular dementia but not vascular dementia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The patients with headaches had a 105% increased risk of dementia. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: In a cohort of patients diagnosed with cervical artery dissection (CeAD), to determine the proportion of patients aged ≥60 years and compare the frequency of characteristics (presenting symptoms, risk factors, and outcome) in patients aged <60 vs ≥60 years.\n",
      "METHODS: We combined data from 3 large cohorts of consecutive patients diagnosed with CeAD (i.e., Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients-Plus consortium). We dichotomized cases into 2 groups, age ≥60 and <60 years, and compared clinical characteristics, risk factors, vascular features, and 3-month outcome between the groups. First, we performed a combined analysis of pooled individual patient data. Secondary analyses were done within each cohort and across cohorts. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 2,391 patients diagnosed with CeAD, we identified 177 patients (7.4%) aged ≥60 years. In this age group, cervical pain (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.47 [0.33-0.66]), headache (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.58 [0.42-0.79]), mechanical trigger events (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.53 [0.36-0.77]), and migraine (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.58 [0.39-0.85]) were less frequent than in younger patients. In turn, hypercholesterolemia (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52 [1.1-2.10]) and hypertension (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.08 [2.25-4.22]) were more frequent in older patients. Key differences between age groups were confirmed in secondary analyses. In multivariable, adjusted analyses, favorable outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was less frequent in the older age group (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.45 [0.25, 0.83]).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In our study population of patients diagnosed with CeAD, 1 in 14 was aged ≥60 years. In these patients, pain and mechanical triggers might be missing, rendering the diagnosis more challenging and increasing the risk of missed CeAD diagnosis in older patients.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraines, Which Affect About 10% Of School-Age Children In The United States, Can Significantly Impair Quality Of Life. Despite Potential Disability, Many Children Do Not Receive Treatment Or Prophylaxis, Since Medications Specifically Approved For Children Are Significantly Less Than For Adults. There Is Also Controversy Surrounding The Apparent Widespread Practice Of Prescribing Off-Label Medications For Children With Migraines. However, Little Research Has Been Done To Identify Physician-Prescribing Patterns Of Migraine Medication For Children.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To Investigate The Prevalence And Pattern Of Off-Label Prescribing For Children With Migraines.\n",
      "METHODS: A Secondary Data Analysis Was Conducted Using The Pooled National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (Namcs) 2011 And 2012. Patients Aged 17 Years Or Younger With A Migraine Diagnosis Were Included. A Series Of Weighted Descriptive Analyses Were Used To Estimate The Prevalence Of Migraine Drugs Prescribed During Pediatric Office Visits. A Weighted Logistic Regression Was Constructed To Compare The Prescribing Patterns Between Off-Label And Fda-Approved Medications. Analyses Used Sas 9.4 Methodology And Incorporated Sample Weights To Adjust For The Complex Sampling Design Employed By Namcs.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of The 12.9 Million Outpatient Visits With A Migraine Diagnosis That Took Place Between 2010 And 2012, 1.2 Million Were Pediatric Visits. Females Accounted For Nearly Twice The Number Of Migraine Visits Than Males (66% Vs. 34%). Children Aged 12-17 Years Accounted For The Highest Frequency Of Visits (84%), Compared With Those Aged Under 12 Years (16%). 66.7% Of These Pediatric Patients Received At Least 1 Migraine Drug. Of These, Off-Label Medications Were Prescribed 1.5 Times More Than Fda-Approved Medications For Children (60.34% Vs. 39.65%). The Results Of Logistic Regression Showed A Significant Likelihood Of Prescribing Off-Label Medications Based On Physician Specialty, Patient Race, And Reason For Visit. Neurologists (Or = 0.028, P < 0.05) And Pediatricians (Or = 0.095, P < 0.05) Were Less Likely To Prescribe Off-Label Drugs Than General And Family Practitioners. Visits For Preventive Care (Or = 5.8, P < 0.05) And Flare-Ups From Chronic Migraines (Or = 5.0, P < 0.05) Were More Likely To Result In Off-Label Drug Prescriptions Than Visits For New Migraine Incidence.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This Study Provides Significant Real-World Evidence Of The Widespread Practice Of Prescribing Off-Label Drugs To Children With Migraines. Although Medical Literature Shows That Off-Label Prescribing May Not Be Harmful, There Is A Dearth Of Research And Practice Guidelines To Help Practitioners Uphold Safety Standards And Ensure The Prescription Of Age-Appropriate Medications To Children.\n",

      "SETTINGS: A tertiary referral multicenter study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred and eighty-eight adult patients with unilateral MD.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: best predictors to define clinical subgroups with potential different aetiologies.\n",
      "RESULTS: We established five clusters in unilateral MD. Group 1 is the most frequently found, includes 53% of patients, and it is defined as the sporadic, classic MD without migraine and without autoimmune disorder (AD). Group 2 is found in 8% of patients, and it is defined by hearing loss, which antedates the vertigo episodes by months or years (delayed MD), without migraine or AD in most of cases. Group 3 involves 13% of patients, and it is considered familial MD, while group 4, which includes 15% of patients, is linked to the presence of migraine in all cases. Group 5 is found in 11% of patients and is defined by a comorbid AD. We found significant differences in the distribution of AD in clusters 3, 4 and 5 between patients with uni- and bilateral MD.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and migraine frequently co-exist. Stress is a major contributing factor for both. Our medical students are subjected to stress related to the implicit responsibility of courses. But the prevalence of IBS, migraine and co-existing migraine in medical students is not known.\n",
      "AIM: To estimate the prevalence of migraine, IBS and co-existing IBS and migraine among medical students. A Cross-Sectional Survey.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-reported questionnaire based study, was conducted in which migraine was defined according to International Headache Society (IHS) criteria while IBS by both Asian criteria and Rome III criteria. Both preclinical (n=142) and clinical students (n=151) of four medical colleges (government and private) of Dhaka and Sylhet district participated in the study. Statistical Analysis: Student's t-test and chi-square test were used to compare the distributions of continuous data and categorical data respectively with significance level set at 0.05 or less.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 293 students (mean age 21.09 ± 2.24 years) volunteered in the study (Males= 177), 14 (4.8%, 11 males, 3 females, p = 0.175) met the criteria for IBS with comparable prevalence among preclinical and clinical (4.2% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.787) students from both private and government institutions (2.1% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.055). IBS-D was the most prevalent subtype (n = 8, M = 6) and abdominal pain relieved by defecation (n = 11), was the most prevalent symptom. Fifty percent (n = 7) of IBS patients considered their bowel habit as normal. Among the 221 (75.4%) students with headache, only 51 (17.4%, 20 males and 31 females, p = 0.001) were diagnosed of migraine, with comparable prevalence among preclinical and clinical students (16.2% vs. 18.5%, p = 0.645). Only 17 (33%) subjects with migraine had accompanying aura. Common triggers were stress (n = 43), lack of sleep (n = 42), and daily life events. Twelve (23.5%) subjects with migraine had migraine-associated frequent disability. Only two female students with IBS-D (14.3%) had concomitant IBS and migraine.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: IBS and concomitant migraine - IBS prevalence was found to be low in our medical students, but migraine prevalence corresponds to other countries as well as in medical students.\n",

      "METHODS: We conducted systematic searches in database PubMed and Embase. Treatment effectiveness was compared by synthesizing direct and indirect evidences using NMA. The surface under curve ranking area (SUCRA) was created to rank those interventions.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eletriptan and rizatriptan are superior to sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan, ibuprofen and aspirin with respect to pain-relief. When analyzing 2 h-nausea-absence, rizatriptan has a better efficacy than sumatriptan, while other treatments indicate no distinctive difference compared with placebo. Furthermore, sumatriptan demonstrates a higher incidence of all-adverse-event compared with diclofenac-potassium, ibuprofen and almotriptan.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study suggests that eletriptan may be the most suitable therapy for migraine from a comprehensive point of view. In the meantime ibuprofen may also be a good choice for its excellent tolerability. Multi-component medication also attracts attention and may be a promising avenue for the next generation of migraine treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) injection as preventive therapies for chronic migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: A pilot, randomized study was conducted on a small-scale sample of 29 Egyptian patients with chronic migraine, recruited from Kasr Al-Aini teaching hospital outpatient clinic and diagnosed according to ICHD-III (beta version). Patients were randomly assigned into two groups; 15 patients received BTX-A injection following the Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy injection paradigm and 14 patients were subjected to 12 rTMS sessions delivered at high frequency (10 Hz) over the left motor cortex (MC, M1). All the patients were requested to have their 1-month headache calendar, and they were subjected to a baseline 25-item (beta version) Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), and visual analogue scale assessment of headache intensity. The primary efficacy measures were headache frequency and severity; secondary measures were 25-item HDI, HIT-6, and number of acute medications. Follow-up visits were scheduled at weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 after baseline visit.\n",
      "RESULTS: A reduction in all outcome measures was achieved in both the groups. However, this improvement was more sustained in the BTX-A group, and both the therapies were well tolerated.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: BTX-A injection and rTMS have favorable efficacy and safety profiles in chronic migraineurs. rTMS is of comparable efficacy to BTX-A injection in chronic migraine therapy, but with less sustained effect.\n",

      "AIMS: The aim of this review is to study the clinical and epidemiological features of NH in a patient population of South India and to compare this with that of described in the international literature.\n",
      "SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective, observational study conducted in a tertiary care center.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients attending the medicine and neurology outpatient departments of a tertiary referral hospital in South India diagnosed to have NH as per the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 beta (2013) criteria were studied over 30 months. All of the patients had a normal neurological examination. Neuroimaging findings were normal, except in one patient.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 19 females and 10 males were studied. The mean age of onset was 47.62 years (range 36-60). The duration of headache varied from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 5 years, with a mean of 24.17 months. The site of headache was predominantly in the parietal area 15 (51.72%), followed by the occipital area 7 (24.13%). The mean diameter of the affected area was 3.23 cm. The intensity of the headache proved to be mild to moderate with a mean visual analog scale score of 5.03. The quality of pain was mainly felt as burning dysesthesia 12 (41.38%). In the majority of patients, i.e. 21 (72.41%), pain was chronic and continuous. None of the patients had any significant trophic change even though paresthesias, dysesthesias, and allodynia were reported by a significant minority of patients, i.e. 9 (31.03%). Only one (3.45%) patient gave a history of head injury. Ten (34.48%) out of 29 patients had other types of concurrent headaches; the majority of which proved to be migrainous, i.e. 7 (24.14%), 2 patients (6.89%) with tension headache, and 1 patient (3.45%) with trigeminal neuralgia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our study proves the existence of the newly described primary headache syndrome called NH in South Indian population. In comparing our results with the international literature, the number of similarities is much greater than the differences. The etiology of pain in our series appeared to be primarily peripheral with a role for central pain sensitization in some cases due to a variety of concurrent central causes of head pain.\n",

      "METHODS: Participants in the study were 114 patients with AMD, 63 male and 51 female, mean-aged 76.5 ± 6.1 years. Demographic data, lifestyle factors, and medical history were recorded. All patients underwent a routine examination for AMD, including best-corrected visual acuity measurement, dilated fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography, and completed three questionnaires assessing quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D, NEI VFQ-25). In addition, 100 controls, adjusted for gender and age, were included in the study. Risk factors for quality of life in AMD patients were investigated. Univariate analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with AMD scored lower in vision- and health-related quality-of-life questionnaires compared to controls. Risk factors associated with quality of life in patients with AMD were found to be the female gender, alcohol consumption, the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, myosceletal problems, migraine, anxiety/depression, subretinal or intraretinal fluid, pigment epithelium detachment, previous treatment for AMD, visual acuity, the stage of the disease, and the integrity of the ellipsoid zone.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with AMD presented lower quality of life in comparison with controls. Potential risk factors should be taken into account and clinicians should thus focus on the most vulnerable subgroups.\n",

      "CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction is a major problem both in women with MS and in women with migraine and is strongly associated with comorbid depression and impaired quality of life. Thus, categorizing sexuality as done by MSISQ-19 is limited by its complex biopsychosocial interactions.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life is used to denote that portion of the quality of life that is influenced by the person's health.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To compare the health-related quality of life of individuals with vestibular disorders of peripheral origin by analyzing functional, emotional and physical disabilities before and after vestibular treatment.\n",
      "METHODS: A prospective, non randomized case-controlled study was conduced in the ENT Department, between January 2015 and December 2015. All patients were submitted to customize a 36 item of health survey on quality of life, short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory for assessing the disability. Individuals were diagnosed with acute unilateral vestibular peripheral disorders classified in 5 groups: vestibular neuritis, Ménière Disease, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, cochlear-vestibular dysfunction (other than Ménière Disease), or other type of acute peripheral vertigo (as vestibular migraine).\n",
      "RESULTS: There was a statistical significant difference for each parameter of Dizziness Handicap Inventory score (the emotional, functional and physical) between the baseline and one month both in men and women, but with any statistical significant difference between 7 days and 14 days. It was found a statistical significant difference for all eight parameters of SF-36 score between the baseline and one month later both in men and women; the exception was the men mental health perception. The correlation between the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the SF-36 scores according to diagnostics type pointed out that the Spearman's correlation coefficient was moderate correlated with the total scores of these instruments.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the SF-36 are useful, proved practical and valid instruments for assessing the impact of dizziness on the quality of life of patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: This study was designed to compare the efficacy of the medical treatment versus the surgical treatment approach to decompression of trigger point nerves in patients with migraine headaches.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty volunteers were randomly assigned to the medical treatment group (n = 25) or the surgical treatment group (n = 25) after examination by the team neurologist to ensure a diagnosis of migraine headache. All patients received botulinum toxin type A to confirm the trigger sites. The surgical treatment group underwent surgical deactivation of the trigger site(s). The medical treatment group underwent prophylactic pharmacologic interventions by the neurologist. Pretreatment and 12-month posttreatment migraine headache frequency, duration, and intensity were analyzed and compared to determine the success of the treatments.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nineteen of the 25 patients (76%) in the surgical treatment group and 10 of the 25 patients (40%) in the medical treatment group experienced a successful outcome (at least a 50% decrease in migraine frequency, duration, or intensity) after 1 year from surgery. Surgical treatment had a significantly higher success rate than medical treatment (P < 0.001). Nine patients (36%) in the surgical treatment group and one patient (4%) in the medical treatment group experienced cessation of migraine headaches. The elimination rate was significantly higher in the surgical treatment group than in the medical treatment group (P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 1-year follow-up data, there is strong evidence that surgical manipulation of one or more migraine trigger sites can successfully eliminate or reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of migraine headaches in a lasting manner.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate and classify headaches in adult people with epilepsy, to evaluate the burden of headaches, and to compare findings with a population-based epidemiological study.\n",
      "METHODS: Two hundred eighty (61.4% women) people with epilepsy (mean age 37.8±14.5, mean duration of epilepsy 13.2±11.9years) completed a questionnaire collecting socio-demographic and clinical data, questions clarifying their type of a headache, a Qolie-10 questionnaire and a Headache-Attributed Lost Time (HALT) index. An experienced neurologist also interviewed them.\n",
      "RESULTS: 83.2% of respondents reported some type of headache. From those with inter-ictal headaches (77.9%), 39% reported tension-type headache, 31.7% reported migraine, and 7.8% reported medication-overuse headache and 16% reported possible persistent headache attributed to traumatic head injury. The impact of headache assessed through the HALT grading showed that 40.4% were grade 1, 9.6% grade 2, 14.7% grade 3 and 35.3% grade 4. Although, the prevalences of different headache types were similar to those in our population-based study, migraine seemed to be more common in males with epilepsy than in general population, and medication-overuse headache was more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: People with epilepsy experience headaches irrespective of their sex or age. The burden of headaches is very important in patients with epilepsy, since headaches usually cause a moderate or severe burden to their quality of life and suggest a clear clinical need. Clinicians should recognize headache as a common comorbidity of epilepsy, as it may influence antiepileptic drug choice, and may need specific treatment.\n",

      "UNLABELLED: Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a challenging neurological disease, which brings frustration for sufferers and treating physicians. The patient's lack of adherence and limited treatment evidence are frequent. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome and treatment strategies between consecutive MOH patients with daily and near-daily headache from a tertiary center.\n",
      "METHODS: Every consecutive patient seen between January and December 2014 with the diagnosis of MOH was included. Psychiatric comorbidities, inability to inform baseline headache frequency, current or previous two-month use of preventive medications, and refusal to sign informed consent were exclusion criteria. The patients were evaluated in thorough initial consultations and divided in two groups based on their baseline headache frequency. The diagnosis and treatment strategies were clearly explained. The filling out of a detailed headache diary was requested from all patients. Endpoints compared headache frequency and adherence after two, four, and eight months between the two study groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: One-hundred sixty-eight patients (31 male, 137 female) met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen patients (11.3%) were excluded. All patients had migraine or chronic migraine as primary headaches. Eighty had daily (DH), and 69 near-daily headache (NDH), at baseline consultation. Mean baseline frequency was 24.8 headache days/month (18.9 days/month for the near-daily group), average headache history was 20.6 years and mean time with >15 headache days/month was 4.8 years. Outpatient withdrawal, starting prevention, and enforcing the correct use of rescue therapy was carried out with all patients. After two months, 88% of the DH and 71% of the NDH groups adhered to treatment (p = 0.0002). The HF decreased to 12 and 9 headache days/month, respectively in DH and NDH groups (p > 0.05, non-significant) (Intention-to-treat (ITT) 14 DH; 12 NDH; p > 0.05). After four and eight months, 86.3% and 83.7% of the DH patients, and 59.4% and 55% of the NDH patients were still under treatment (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0001). The HF decreased, respectively, to nine and nine headache days/month in the DH patients compared to 6 and 7 headache days/month in the NDH group (p > 0.05) (ITT, 12; 12; DH; 10; 11; NDH; p > 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although open studies provide limited conclusions, withdrawing overused medications and starting prevention may have helped the favorable outcomes. However, daily headache patients had a significantly higher adherence and lower relapse rates than near-daily headache patients, despite a considerable reduced headache frequency in both groups. Additionally, real-world patient studies are scarce and the comparison between these two subsets of patients may be useful to guide clinicians in approaching their patients. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease involves several systems in the body. Neurological involvement is identified by different symptoms. Headache is one of the common complaints of patients with Behcet's disease. It might be a part of neurological involvement or may arise independently in the course of disease. Studies with small sample size have resulted in various findings in this field. Since the prevalence of Behcet's disease is relatively high in Iran, this study was carried out to compare the features of headache between an acceptable number of patients with this rare disease and a control group.\n",
      "METHODS: The current case-control study was performed to compare the features of headache between 312 patients with definite Behcet's disease who referred to a Behcet's clinic and healthy individuals. Patients with Behcet's disease were randomly selected. Controls were matched for age and sex. They were personally examined and interviewed meticulously using a questionnaire that met the standards of the International Headache Society classification for different types of headache.\n",
      "RESULTS: The incidence of headache in the case and control groups was 28.3 % (n = 120) and 18.6 % (n = 59), respectively (p < 0.05; OR 2.73). Tension-type headache was observed in 12.2 % (n = 38) of cases which was significantly higher than control group (n = 6.3 %) (p = 0.011; OR 2.05). The most frequent type of headache in the case group was tension-type headache (12.2 %). In the control group, however, migraine without aura was the most common type (9.1 %). A correlation between ophthalmological involvement and headache was observed in 11 patients in the case group. In addition, a significantly higher systolic blood pressure was found in the case group compared to the controls (125.1 vs. 121.7 mmHg; p = 0.007). There was no major correlation between prednisolone consumption in patients with Behcet's disease and the type and frequency of headache.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Headache, especially tension-type headache, is more common in patients with Behcet's disease. This might be the result of specific types of uveitis-related and non-structural headaches seen in Behcet's disease.\n",

Intrinsic factors, however, may also affect postural control. We sought to compare the postural control of female and male athletes as measured simultaneously by (1) the modified balance error scoring system (mBESS) and (2) a video-force plate system.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "SETTING: Sports injury prevention center.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Pediatric, adolescent, and young adult athletes who performed mBESS during an injury prevention evaluation.\n",
      "INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: We compared the postural control of female and male athletes. We also accounted for independent variables associated with postural stability, including age, body mass index, and history of ankle injury, concussion, and migraine headache.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total errors committed during the mBESS and measurements derived from integrated kinematic and kinetic data obtained by a video-force plate system. Differences between males and females were tested using analysis of covariance.\n",
      "RESULTS: Participants (n = 409) ranged in age from 10 to 29 years (mean = 14.6 ± 2.8); 60% were female. No significant differences on mBESS were detected between females and males; however, female athletes demonstrated significantly better postural stability on the video-force plate analysis during double-leg (P = 0.03, d = 0.28), single-leg (P < 0.001, d = 0.62), and tandem stances (P < 0.001, d = 0.53) when compared with males.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Uninjured female athletes demonstrate better postural stability on video-force plate analysis than their uninjured male counterparts. These findings provide an important information assistive to clinicians during interpretation of postinjury balance tests.\n",

      "METHODS: This analysis compares and contrasts the study methods and participation rates of the AMPP and CaMEO studies. We then compare and contrast baseline results in terms of demographic characteristics, headache features, and disability as measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) among people with episodic and chronic migraine.\n",
      "RESULTS: AMPP and CaMEO sampled from panels constructed to be representative of the US population. The AMPP Study collected data using a mailed questionnaire while CaMEO relied on a web survey methodology. Response rates were higher in AMPP (64.8%) than in CaMEO (16.5%). Both studies assessed headache features using the American Migraine Study/AMPP diagnostic module. Both identified persons with episodic (<15 headache days/month) and chronic migraine (≥15 headache days/month) based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders. AMPP collected data annually over 5 years, while CaMEO collected data quarterly over 15 months. Baseline demographic distribution was generally similar, indicating that each study was broadly representative of the US population. The proportion of persons with migraine who had chronic migraine was similar (AMPP, 6.6%; CaMEO, 8.8%). Respondents had similar median headache frequency (days/month) by sex for chronic migraine (AMPP: men = 21.7, women = 20.0; CaMEO: men = 20.0, women = 20.0) and episodic migraine (AMPP: men = 1.7, women = 2.0; CaMEO: men = 2.0, women = 3.0). Median MIDAS scores were substantially higher in both studies for chronic migraine (severe disability [Grade IV]; AMPP: men = 33.0, women = 45.0; CaMEO: men = 32.0, women = 38.0) than episodic migraine (little/mild disability [Grade I/II]; AMPP: men = 3.0, women = 6.0; CaMEO: men = 4.0, women = 7.0). Rates of moderate/severe disability (Grade III/IV) were substantially higher in both studies for chronic migraine (AMPP: men = 66.9%, women = 78.9%; CaMEO: men = 71.0%, women = 82.6%) than episodic migraine (AMPP: men = 23.0%, women = 31.8%; CaMEO: men = 26.7%, women = 37.9%). More women than men respondents in both studies experienced moderate/severe disability.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: AMPP and CaMEO are longitudinal cohort studies that used different methods, but yielded similar results for demographic features, headache frequency, and headache-related disability. Both studies found more severe headache-related disability in those with chronic versus episodic migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS) with a view to understand mechanisms.\n",
      "METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 162 patients with RCVS. Clinical, brain imaging, and angiography data were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age was 44±13 years, 78% women. Hemorrhages occurred in 43% including 21 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 62 with convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH). The frequency of triggers (eg, vasoconstrictive drugs) and risk factors (eg, migraine) were not significantly different between hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic RCVS or between subgroups (ICH versus non-ICH, isolated cSAH versus normal scan). Hemorrhagic lesions occurred within the first week, whereas infarcts and vasogenic edema accumulated during 2 to 3 weeks (P<0.001). Although all ICHs occurred before cSAH, their time course was not significantly different (P=0.11). ICH and cSAH occurred earlier than infarcts (P≤0.001), and ICH earlier than vasogenic edema (P=0.009). Angiogram analysis showed more severe vasoconstriction in distal versus proximal segments in all lesion types (ICH, cSAH, infarction, vasogenic edema, and normal scan). The isolated infarction group had more severe proximal vasoconstriction, and those with normal imaging had significantly less vasoconstriction. Multivariable analysis failed to uncover independent predictors of hemorrhagic RCVS; however, female sex predicted ICH (P=0.048), and angiographic severity predicted infarction (P=0.043).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: ICH and cSAH are common complications of RCVS. Triggers and risk factors do not predict lesion subtype but may alter central vasomotor control mechanisms resulting in centripetal angiographic evolution. Early distal vasoconstriction is associated with lobar ICH and cSAH, and delayed proximal vasoconstriction with infarction.\n",

      "METHODS: History of migraine, daily headache diaries, and daily hormone data were collected in ovulatory cycles of pre- and early perimenopausal women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Peak hormone levels, average daily levels, and within-woman day-to-day rates of decline over the 5 days following each hormone peak were calculated in ovulatory cycles for conjugated urinary estrogens (E1c), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Comparisons were made between migraineurs and controls using 2-sample t tests on the log scale with results reported as geometric means.\n",
      "RESULTS: The sample included 114 women with history of migraine and 223 controls. Analyses of within-woman rates of decline showed that E1c decline over the 2 days following the luteal peak was greater in migraineurs for both absolute rate of decline (33.8 [95% confidence interval 28.0-40.8] pg/mgCr vs 23.1 [95% confidence interval 20.1-26.6] pg/mgCr, p = 0.002) and percent change (40% vs 30%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between migraineurs and controls in absolute peak or daily E1c, pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Secondary analyses demonstrated that, among migraineurs, the rate of E1c decline did not differ according to whether a headache occurred during the cycle studied.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraineurs are characterized by faster late luteal phase E1c decline compared to controls. The timing and rate of estrogen withdrawal before menses may be a marker of neuroendocrine vulnerability in women with migraine.\n",

In contrast, the values of cold-stress-vasoconstriction forearm blood-flow reactivity (p <0.001), the increase in diastolic blood pressure in handgrip test (p <0.001), mean blood pressure in the late stage of the second phase of Valsalva Maneuver (p <0.001) and blood pressure variability (p <0.005) were all higher in patients with migraine than in the control group.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Thus, both episodic and chronic migraine are associated with significant disturbances in autonomous control resulting in enhanced vascular reactivity whereas the cardiac regulation remains largely unchanged.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Headache is a common complaint among children. The most common primary headache syndromes in childhood are migraine and TTH. However many times they seem to overlap. The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between pediatric migraine, tension-type headache (TTH) and learning disabilities.\n",
      "METHODS: Children presenting with headache to three pediatric neurology clinics in the last 5 years were assessed. Two hundred sixty-two children, 5-18 years of age, who met the criteria for migraine were included.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 262 children (54 % female) who had migraine, 26.2 % had migraine with aura. 59 children (22.5 % of the full sample) reported also having headaches that met the criteria for episodic TTH/mixed headaches. Females were more than 2.8 times more likely to experience mixed headaches than males (OR: 2.81, 95 % CI: 1.43-5.54; p <.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that older age (p <0.02), family history of aura (p <.02), and (lack of) TTH (p <.003) were significant predictors of aura, whereas gender was not significant (p >0.20). Children who had migraine with aura were less likely to have mixed headaches than children who did not have aura (OR: 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.11-0.63; p <.003). Children with mixed headaches were 2.7 times more likely to have a learning disability than children with migraine alone.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Episodic TTH and migraine without aura (mixed headaches) in children might be part of a continuum, which can explain the high incidence of their co-occurrence as opposed to migraine with aura. Children with mixed headaches have a higher incidence of learning disability compare to those with migraine alone.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends that combined hormonal contraceptives (ie, birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions because of the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. Whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweigh the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18-40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication: hypertension, smokers older than age 35 years, a history of venous thromboembolism, diabetes with complications, coronary artery disease, systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibodies, breast cancer, or migraine headaches with aura. χ(2) tests for general association were used to compare combined hormonal contraceptives use, contraceptive health provider characteristics, and sociodemographic data in women with and without contraindications to estrogen use.\n",
      "RESULTS: The MyNewOptions baseline study sample included 987 adult women who were mostly young (46% were 18-25 years), white (94%), employed (70%), and married or cohabiting (54%). Thirteen percent (n = 130) of the sample had a medical contraindication to estrogen-containing contraceptive use: migraine with aura (81%) was the most common contraindication, followed by smokers older than age 35 years (7%), hypertension (11%), history of venous thromboembolism (4%), and diabetes with complications (2%). High use of combined hormonal contraceptives was reported among the women with medical contraindications to estrogen at 39% (n = 51). This was not statistically different from women without a medical contraindication (47%, P = .1). Among the 130 women with a contraindication, whether they did or did not use an estrogen-containing contraceptive did not vary by education level, income, or weight category. With respect to their contraceptive prescribers, there were no differences in prescriber specialty, provider type, or clinic type comparing women using and not using an estrogen-containing contraceptive.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Among this study sample of reproductive-age women, there was a high rate of combined hormonal contraceptive use in women with a medical contraindication to estrogen use. These women may be at an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Processes need to be improved to ensure that women with medical contraindications to estrogen-containing contraception are being offered the safest and most effective methods, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Compare the similarities and differences among headache intake forms from headache centers with United Council of Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS) accredited headache medicine fellowships in the United States. Patient intake forms establish a first communication with patients. There have been no studies evaluating them at headache centers. Analysis of these forms can provide insight into their content and potential for improvement.\n",
      "METHODS: This observational study involved collection and analysis of intake forms from 25 UCNS fellowship accredited headache centers from July 2014 to October 2014. Forms were compared and contrasted in terms of data fields included, response format, and use of validated assessment tools.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forms shared many common elements, yet were highly variable in content, style, scales, and methods of analysis. Twenty percent (5/20) of centers did not have a formal intake form. Forms ranged from 1 to 28 pages. Seventy percent (12/17) utilized a check box format, 23% (4/17) utilized an open ended/fill in the blank format, and 6% (1/17) utilized a circle the response(s) format. Family history was inquired about in 82% (14/17) of forms and past medical history (PMH) in 58% (10/17) of forms. Gender questions were asked 82% (14/17) of the time for women, 29% (5/17) for men. Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of forms had questions concerning any type of previous medication tried.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Patient intake forms are useful for clinical purposes, but vary markedly between UCNS headache centers. Ultimately, a universal intake form could be generated, providing a research-based alternative to the form currently used at each center. Use of a standardized intake form by UCNS centers would streamline data collection, a good first step in the eventual generation of a headache registry.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the societal direct and indirect costs of chronic and episodic migraine in the United States.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Episodic and chronic migraine are distinguished by the frequency of headache-days. Chronic migraine has a greater overall impact on quality of life than does episodic migraine. Individuals with chronic migraine also use more healthcare resources (resulting in higher direct costs) and experience greater decreases in productivity (resulting in higher indirect costs) than those with episodic migraine as shown in the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study.\n",
      "METHODS: The International Burden of Migraine Study utilized a web-based questionnaire to elicit data on several topics related to the burden of migraine illness, including health resource utilization and productivity losses. Potential survey participants were identified by Synovate Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA) from a pool of registered panelists from various countries. The panelists were screened online to determine eligibility and to identify individuals with migraine (episodic or chronic), based on reported symptoms. Participants from the United States were divided into episodic and chronic migraine groups, based on reported headache-day per month frequency. Direct and indirect costs were estimated by applying estimated unit costs to reported headache-related productivity losses and resource use. Costs were compared between participants with episodic and chronic migraine.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean [standard deviation] total annual cost of headache among people with chronic migraine ($8243 [$10,646]) was over three times that of episodic migraine ($2649 [$4634], P < .001). Participants with chronic migraine had significantly greater direct medical costs ($4943 [$6382]) and indirect (lost productivity) costs ($3300 [$6907]) than did participants with episodic migraine (direct, $1705 [$3591]; indirect, $943 [$2084]) (P < .001 for each). Unlike previous findings, direct medical costs constituted the majority of total headache-related costs for both chronic migraine (60.0%, $4943 of $8243) and episodic migraine (64.3%, $1705 of $2649) participants. A large portion of direct medical costs are attributable to pharmaceutical utilization among both chronic migraine (80%, $3925 of 4943) and episodic migraine (70%, $1196 of $1705) participants.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The results of this study build on previous results of the AMPP Study, demonstrating that headache-related direct, indirect, and total costs are significantly greater among individuals with chronic migraine than with episodic migraine in the United States.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the interictal spontaneous brain activity between migraine without aura (MwoA) patients, Migraine with visual aura (MA) patients and healthy control subjects in order to provide further insights into the complex migraine pathophysiology.\n",
      "METHODS: Twenty-three eligible MwoA patients, twelve MA patients who were treated in the neurology clinics in the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from March to October 2014 and twenty-five gender-, age- and education- matched healthy volunteers participated in this study.After demographic and clinical characteristics were acquired, a 3.0-T MRI system was used to obtain rfMRI.ReHo method was applied to analyze the synchronization of the BOLD signal in the same time series among neighboring voxels of the brain.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, MwoA patients showed significant decreases in ReHo values in the right thalamus, right putamen, right prefrontal lobe and right hippocampus (P<0.05); while MA patients showed significant decreases in ReHo values in the right thalamus, right putamen, right cerebellum and brainstem, whereas a significant increase in ReHo values in the right occipital lobe (P<0.05). Furthermore, compared with MA patients, increased ReHo values in the right cerebellum and brainstem were shown in the MwoA group (P<0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the resting-state abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in migraine.Specifically, the results of brain regions may reflect both the similarities and differences of pathophysiological mechanisms relative to the major subtypes of migraine.\n",

However, the dosage used in this study was flexible from 155 U to 195 U at the physician's discretion. Therefore, the objective of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy and safety of OnabotulinumtoxinA 195 U vs. 155 U for the treatment of CM and medication overuse headache (MOH) during a 2-year period.\n",
      "METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the mean reduction in headache days, migraine days, acute pain medication intake days and Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6 score in 172 patients injected with OnabotulinumtoxinA 195 U. Successively, we compared the efficacy measures with data of 155 patients injected with OnabotulinumtoxinA 155 U and followed up for 2 years. All patients were affected by CM and MOH, and failed one or more previous detoxification and preventative therapies.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both OnabotulinumtoxinA 195 U and 155 U reduced significantly the number of headache and migraine days, acute pain medication intake days and HIT-6 score, when compared with the baseline measures. Nevertheless, OnabotulinumtoxinA 195 U proved to be superior of 155 U in all efficacy measures since the first injection and for all the 2 years of treatment, with the exception of the reduction in pain medication intake days that resulted significantly larger with 195 U only after the 4th injection. The safety and tolerability of the two doses were similar and treatment related adverse events were transient and mild-moderate.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest and longest post-marketing studies of doses comparison with OnabotulinumtoxinA in a real-life clinical setting. Here, we demonstrate the superior efficacy of OnabotulinumtoxinA 195 U compared to 155 U in CM patients with MOH during a 2-year treatment period with similar safety and tolerability profile.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine patients' perspectives on subcutaneously administered self-injectable medications when compared with other routes or methods of administration for the same medicines.\n",
      "METHODS: Nine electronic databases were searched for publications since 2000 using terms pertaining to methods of administration, choice behavior, and adverse effects. Eligibility for inclusion was determined through reference to specific criteria by two independent reviewers. Results were described narratively.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 1726 papers screened, 85 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were focused mainly on methods of insulin administration for diabetes but also included treatments for pediatric growth disorders, multiple sclerosis, HIV, and migraine. Pen devices and autoinjectors were favored over administration with needle and syringe, particularly with respect to ergonomics, convenience, and portability. Inhalation appeared to be more acceptable than subcutaneous injection (in the case of insulin), but how subcutaneous infusion, intramuscular injection, and needle-free injection devices compare with subcutaneous injections in terms of patient preference is less certain.\n",

The mortality experience of CAW-E relative to patients with other common neurologic disorders in the pediatric age group is yet undetermined. The objectives of this study are the following: (1) to compare the causes and the adjusted risk of death in CAW-E with that of children and adolescents with migraine (CAW-M) in reference to children and adolescents with lower extremity fracture (CAW-LEF), and children and adolescents in the general population; (2) to evaluate if disparate mortality risks exist by demographic characteristics.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 56,781 children and adolescents 0-18 years of age hospitalized or treated in an emergency or outpatient department from 2000 to 2011 for epilepsy, migraine, or lower extremity fracture from all nonfederal health care facilities. Data on deaths were acquired from linked multiple causes of death data file using person-specific unique identifiers. Time of follow-up was from initial clinical encounter to time of death or censoring date of December 31, 2011. The association of risk characteristics with mortality was examined with Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for potential confounders.\n",
      "RESULTS: Four hundred forty-seven CAW-E and 125 CAW-M died yielding mortality rates of 8.71 and 1.36 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The 5-year risk of death was 4.38% for CAW-E, 0.68% for CAW-M, and 0.71% for CAW-LEF. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 3.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.08-3.72) in CAW-E and 1.14 (95% CI 0.94-1.34) in CAW-M relative to CAW-LEF.

      "OBJECTIVE: Topiramate (TPM) is an antiepileptic drug that is also used for other indications (e.g., migraine). Adverse event (AE) data from epilepsy trials could be supplemented by data from trials in other indications. Combining data across trials and indications is a novel method for evaluating AEs. We conducted a multiple-indications review by systematically reviewing randomized placebo-controlled trials of TPM, to compare the nervous system AEs of TPM in epilepsy with those in other indications.\n",
      "METHODS: Randomized placebo-controlled trials of TPM including patients with any indication were included. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2012) and MEDLINE (1966-February 2012). Two authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. For each reported nervous system AE, we extracted event rates, applied random-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis (pooling within-indications then across-indications), and assessed within- and across-indication heterogeneity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ninety trials, including 16 epilepsy trials, were included. A difference was detected between TPM and placebo for three events (i.e., drooling, dysgeusia, and hypoesthesia) that were not reported in epilepsy trials but were reported by other trials. A difference between TPM and placebo was detected for speech disorder using epilepsy trials but not when combining all trials. For two events (i.e., cognitive disorder and \"language problems\"), no difference was detected between TPM and placebo when using epilepsy trials alone, but a difference was identified using all trials. A difference was detected between TPM and placebo for six events (i.e., ataxia, disturbance in attention, dizziness, memory impairment, paraesthesia, and somnolence) when using epilepsy trials alone, and using all trials.\n",
      "SIGNIFICANCE: Including trials of any indication enabled detection of differences that would have been missed using epilepsy trials alone. Multiple-indications reviews can improve the synthesis of AEs for antiepileptic drugs.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine headache is a prevalent periodical and neurological impairment that is associated with functional disorders. Regarding the side effects of available medications, research is continuing in an effort to identify new, effective pharmaceutical regimens with limited side effects.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of vitamin B2 versus sodium valproate in migraine prophylaxis.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a single-blind clinical trial conducted on 90 migraine patients in two parallel groups. The first group underwent vitamin B2 treatment (400 mg/day) for three months, and the second group was treated with sodium valproate (500 mg/day). The patients were examined at the beginning of the study and 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. After the administration of the drugs in both groups, we recorded the duration of migraine pain, the frequency of migraine episodes, and the severity of the headaches. Potential complications of this study that were measured were weight gain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems.\n",
      "RESULTS: The findings showed that the frequency, median duration per month, and severity of the headaches decreased in both groups, but the difference between them was not significant (p > 0.05). However, there were significantly fewer side effects in vitamin B2 group (p = 0.005).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Sodium valproate and vitamin B2 have similar effects on the reduction of migraine attacks, but vitamin B2 had fewer complications and fewer adverse effects; therefore, vitamin B2 can be administered to patients who are prohibited from taking sodium valproate or who have adverse side effects when they take it.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to describe the clinical and electrical features and the long-term evolution of childhood occipital epilepsy of Gastaut (COE-G) in a cohort of patients and to compare long-term prognosis between patients with and without other epileptic syndromes.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the long-term outcome of epilepsy in 129 patients with COE-G who were referred to 23 Italian epilepsy centres and one in Austria between 1991 and 2004. Patients were evaluated clinically and with electroencephalograms for 10.1-23.0 years. The following clinical characteristics were evaluated: gender, patient age at seizure onset, history of febrile seizures and migraine, family history of epilepsy, duration and seizure manifestations, circadian distribution and frequency of seizures, history of medications including the number of drugs, therapeutic response and final outcome.\n",
      "RESULTS: Visual hallucinations were the first symptom in 62% and the only manifestation in 38.8% of patients. Patients were subdivided into two groups: group A with isolated COE-G; group B with other epileptic syndromes associated with COE-G. The most significant (P < 0.05) difference concerned antiepileptic therapy: in group A, 45 children responded to monotherapy; in group B only 15 children responded to monotherapy. At the end of follow-up, the percentage of seizure-free patients was significantly higher in group A than in group B.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Childhood occipital epilepsy of Gastaut has an overall favourable prognosis and a good response to antiepileptic therapy with resolution of seizures and of electroencephalogram abnormalities. The association of typical COE-G symptoms with other types of seizure could be related to a poor epilepsy outcome.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To determine whether migraine is associated with an increased risk of developing ocular motor cranial nerve palsies (OMCNP).\n",
      "DESIGN: Nationwide retrospective cohort study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of patients with migraine who were entered in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 2005 and 2009 were retrieved from the NHIRD in Taiwan. Two cohorts were selected: patients with migraine (n = 138 907) and propensity score-matched controls (n = 138 907).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cohorts were followed until the end of 2010, death, or occurrence of cranial nerve (CN)3, CN4, or CN6 palsies. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were used to compare to the risk of developing CN3, CN4, and CN6 palsy between cohorts.\n",
      "RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 1-6 years), the migraine cohort exhibited a greater risk of developing subsequent CN3, CN4, and CN6 palsies compared with the control cohort (HR, 2.67, P < 0.001; HR, 4.23, P < 0.001; HR, 3.37; P < 0.001). This finding was maintained after excluding potential confounders during sensitivity tests. Moreover, the significant association between migraine and OMCNP remained after we adjusted for potential risk factors of microvascular ischemia. However, different migraine subtypes showed no significant differences.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine is an unrecognized risk factor for OMCNP development in adults. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and to delineate the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms linking migraine and OMCNP.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most frequent headaches. Cervical myofascial and trigger point disorders are effective factors on accession of this type of headache. PRT is an indirect technique that treats trigger points.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of trigger points' management by positional release therapy (PRT) combined with routine medical therapy and routine medical therapy alone in treatment of migraine headache.\n",
      "METHODS: Forty-four patients with active trigger points in cervical muscles entered to the study. They were randomly assigned to PRT-medical therapy or medical therapy group. Headache frequency, intensity, duration and tablet count were recorded by use of a daily headache diary. The sensitivity of trigger points was assessed by the use of a digital force gauge (Wagner-FDIX). Cervical range of motion was measured by a goniometer.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both groups showed significant reduction in headache intensity, frequency, duration and tablet count after 4 months follow up. The sensitivity of trigger points and all cervical range of motions significantly increased in PRT-medical group after 4 months follow up; however in medication group except cervical right lateral flexion, right and left rotation the other factors showed no change after 4 months follow up. In comparison of the two study groups, there was no significant difference in headache-related variables. Apart from the headache intensity and tablet count, the trends of other factors were significantly different between the two groups (p <  0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The combined PRT-medical therapy is more effective than the medical therapy alone. Thus, the combination of PRT and medical therapy is suggested as a treatment choice for patients with migraine headache.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Chronic migraine (CM), with or without medication overuse, is a common condition in the general population. It has traditionally been assumed that suffering CM has an impact on a patient's socio-occupational and educational level. Our goal was to analyse these characteristics in a cohort of patients with CM and compare them to the general population.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a telephone interview and an ad hoc questionnaire to record and analyse the sociodemographic characteristics of 150 patients with a diagnosis of CM according to the criteria of the International Headache Classification. Results were compared to those obtained by the Third Health Survey of Asturias, conducted in 2012.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 150 patients, 142 were women (95%). Married patients accounted for 59.3% of the total interviewees, while 22% were single, 12.6% divorced, and 6% were widowed. Regarding educational level, we found that 73% of our patients had completed secondary or higher education and 25% had completed only primary education. Sixty per cent of these patients are occupationally active, while the rest are not actively employed. Overall, these figures do not differ from those published by the Third Health Survey of Asturias.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: The classic idea that CM has a negative impact on patients' educational, personal, and occupational situations was not confirmed in our series. In fact, most patients with CM reported a medium-high educational level and a good socio-occupational status. However, since our series includes only CM patients attended in a specialist clinic, our results are not necessarily applicable to all patients with CM.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the health care costs for patients using additional homeopathic treatment (homeopathy group) with the costs for those receiving usual care (control group).\n",
      "METHODS: Cost data provided by a large German statutory health insurance company were retrospectively analysed from the societal perspective (primary outcome) and from the statutory health insurance perspective. Patients in both groups were matched using a propensity score matching procedure based on socio-demographic variables as well as costs, number of hospital stays and sick leave days in the previous 12 months. Total cumulative costs over 18 months were compared between the groups with an analysis of covariance (adjusted for baseline costs) across diagnoses and for six specific diagnoses (depression, migraine, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and headache).\n",
      "RESULTS: Data from 44,550 patients (67.3% females) were available for analysis. From the societal perspective, total costs after 18 months were higher in the homeopathy group (adj. mean: EUR 7,207.72 [95% CI 7,001.14-7,414.29]) than in the control group (EUR 5,857.56 [5,650.98-6,064.13]; p<0.0001) with the largest differences between groups for productivity loss (homeopathy EUR 3,698.00 [3,586.48-3,809.53] vs. control EUR 3,092.84 [2,981.31-3,204.37]) and outpatient care costs (homeopathy EUR 1,088.25 [1,073.90-1,102.59] vs. control EUR 867.87 [853.52-882.21]). Group differences decreased over time. For all diagnoses, costs were higher in the homeopathy group than in the control group, although this difference was not always statistically significant.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, additional homeopathic treatment was associated with significantly higher costs. These analyses did not confirm previously observed cost savings resulting from the use of homeopathy in the health care system.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Seasonal variation of migraine attack frequency has been described as a phenomenon. We aimed to compare functional disability and the occurrence of cranial autonomic symptoms (CASs) in patients who reported a seasonal variation in their migraine attack frequency with those who did not.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire-based observational study on patients with migraine without aura who visited our institution from January 2005 to December 2013. Patient demographics, headache characteristics, and accompanying symptoms were recorded, and functional disability was evaluated by Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 4423 patients screened, 769 were eligible for analysis, and 104 (13.5%) of them reported seasonal variation. Several CAS features such as conjunctival injection (25.0% vs 14.0%), lacrimation (20.2% vs 10.8%), eyelid edema (20.2% vs 10.2%), forehead and facial sweating (22.1% vs 11.4%), and ptosis (23.1% vs 11.4%) were more prominent in this subset of patients. They showed higher MIDAS scores (15.4 ± 23.5) than the other migraineurs (10.4 ± 16.9), with a 1.77-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.96) of severe functional disability (MIDAS score ≥21) after adjustment for age group, sex, headache frequency, intensity, and duration. The higher the number of CASs, the greater also was the proportion of patients with severe functional disability.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients who reported seasonal variation in migraine also reported more CASs and had more severe functional disability. The profound functional disability in the migraineurs reporting seasonal variation or CAS also provides direction for proactive clinical management in these patients.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Although triptans are widely used in the acute management of migraine, there is uncertainty around the comparative efficacy of triptans among each other and vs non-triptan migraine treatments. We conducted systematic reviews and network meta-analyses to compare the relative efficacy of triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) for acute treatment of migraines compared with other triptan agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetaminophen, ergots, opioids, or anti-emetics.\n",
      "METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) with placebo-controlled or active migraine treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were completed independently by multiple reviewers. Outcome data were combined and analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. For each outcome, odds ratios, relative risks, and absolute probability of response were calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 133 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Standard dose triptans relieved headaches within 2 hours in 42 to 76% of patients, and 2-hour sustained freedom from pain was achieved for 18 to 50% of patients. Standard dose triptans provided sustained headache relief at 24 hours in 29 to 50% of patients, and sustained freedom from pain in 18 to 33% of patients. Use of rescue medications ranged from 20 to 34%. For 2-hour headache relief, standard dose triptan achieved better outcomes (42 to 76% response) than ergots (38%); equal or better outcomes than NSAIDs, ASA, and acetaminophen (46 to 52%); and equal or slightly worse outcomes than combination therapy (62 to 80%). Among individual triptans, sumatriptan subcutaneous injection, rizatriptan ODT, zolmitriptan ODT, and eletriptan tablets were associated with the most favorable outcomes.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSIONS: Triptans are effective for migraine relief. Standard dose triptans are associated with better outcomes than ergots, and most triptans are associated with equal or better outcomes compared with NSAIDs, ASA, and acetaminophen. Use of triptans in combination with ASA or acetaminophen, or using alternative modes of administration such as injectables, may be associated with slightly better outcomes than standard dose triptan tablets.\n",

      "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included randomized controlled trials of adults with migraine headaches of at least 4 weeks in duration.\n",
      "RESULTS: Placebo controlled trials included alpha blockers (n = 9), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 3), angiotensin receptor blockers (n = 3), anticonvulsants (n = 32), beta-blockers (n = 39), calcium channel blockers (n = 12), flunarizine (n = 7), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 6), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (n = 1) serotonin agonists (n = 9) and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 11). In addition there were 53 trials comparing different drugs. Drugs with at least 3 trials that were more effective than placebo for episodic migraines included amitriptyline (SMD: -1.2, 95% CI: -1.7 to -0.82), -flunarizine (-1.1 headaches/month (ha/month), 95% CI: -1.6 to -0.67), fluoxetine (SMD: -0.57, 95% CI: -0.97 to -0.17), metoprolol (-0.94 ha/month, 95% CI: -1.4 to -0.46), pizotifen (-0.43 ha/month, 95% CI: -0.6 to -0.21), propranolol (-1.3 ha/month, 95% CI: -2.0 to -0.62), topiramate (-1.1 ha/month, 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.73) and valproate (-1.5 ha/month, 95% CI: -2.1 to -0.8). Several effective drugs with less than 3 trials included: 3 ace inhibitors (enalapril, lisinopril, captopril), two angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan, telmisartan), two anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, levetiracetam), and several beta-blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol, timolol). Network meta-analysis found amitriptyline to be better than several other medications including candesartan, fluoxetine, propranolol, topiramate and valproate and no different than atenolol, flunarizine, clomipramine or metoprolol.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Several drugs good evidence supporting efficacy. There is weak evidence supporting amitriptyline's superiority over some drugs. Selection of prophylactic medication should be tailored according to patient preferences, characteristics and side effect profiles.\n",

      "METHODS: A total of 37 unilateral patients with migraine (30 women, seven men) who fulfilled the criteria of International Headache Society (2004) were recruited from our outpatient clinic. The control group consisted of 21 healthy individuals (16 women, five men) who are employees or students of our Medical Faculty. Mean latency and maximum amplitude values of sympathetic skin responses obtained from neck areas of the patients during attack, post attack, and interval periods were calculated. We compared the mean latency and the maximum amplitude values of the symptomatic side with the data of the asymptomatic side and with the data of the control group. We also compared the responses of the patients with right-sided headache with the responses of the patients with left-sided headache. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS.\n",
      "RESULTS: On the neck area, we observed sympathetic hypo-function in the attack and interval periods and a relative hyper-function in the post attack period bilaterally, regardless of the symptomatic side.\n",

Analyses showed that improvement in pain duration, frequency and severity in the Colpermin group was better than the placebo group (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Moreover, pain duration and frequency were decreased in the Lactol group more than the placebo (P = 0.012 and P = 0.0001, respectively), but changes in pain severity were not significant (P = 0.373).

      "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of AVP-825, an investigational bi-directional breath-powered intranasal delivery system containing low-dose (22 mg) sumatriptan powder, vs 100 mg oral sumatriptan for acute treatment of migraine in a double-dummy, randomized comparative efficacy clinical trial allowing treatment across multiple migraine attacks.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In phases 2 and 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, AVP-825 provided early and sustained relief of moderate or severe migraine headache in adults, with a low incidence of triptan-related adverse effects.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a randomized, active-comparator, double-dummy, cross-over, multi-attack study (COMPASS; NCT01667679) with two ≤12-week double-blind periods. Subjects experiencing 2-8 migraines/month in the past year were randomized 1:1 using computer-generated sequences to AVP-825 plus oral placebo tablet or an identical placebo delivery system plus 100 mg oral sumatriptan tablet for the first period; patients switched treatment for the second period in this controlled comparative design. Subjects treated ≤5 qualifying migraines per period within 1 hour of onset, even if pain was mild. The primary end-point was the mean value of the summed pain intensity differences through 30 minutes post-dose (SPID-30) using Headache Severity scores. Secondary outcomes included pain relief, pain freedom, pain reduction, consistency of response across multiple migraines, migraine-associated symptoms, and atypical sensations. Safety was also assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 275 adults were randomized, 174 (63.3%) completed the study (ie, completed the second treatment period), and 185 (67.3%) treated at least one migraine in both periods (1531 migraines assessed). There was significantly greater reduction in migraine pain intensity with AVP-825 vs oral sumatriptan in the first 30 minutes post-dose (least squares mean SPID-30 = 10.80 vs 7.41, adjusted mean difference 3.39 [95% confidence interval 1.76, 5.01]; P < .001). At each time point measured between 15 and 90 minutes, significantly greater rates of pain relief and pain freedom occurred with AVP-825 treatment compared with oral sumatriptan. At 2 hours, rates of pain relief and pain freedom became comparable; rates of sustained pain relief and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 48 hours remained comparable. Nasal discomfort and abnormal taste were more common with AVP-825 vs oral sumatriptan (16% vs 1% and 26% vs 4%, respectively), but ∼90% were mild, leading to only one discontinuation. Atypical sensation rates were significantly lower with AVP-825 than with conventional higher dose 100 mg oral sumatriptan.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: AVP-825 (containing 22 mg sumatriptan nasal powder) provided statistically significantly greater reduction of migraine pain intensity over the first 30 minutes following treatment, and greater rates of pain relief and pain freedom within 15 minutes, compared with 100 mg oral sumatriptan. Sustained pain relief and pain freedom through 24 and 48 hours was achieved in a similar percentage of attacks for both treatments, despite substantially lower total systemic drug exposure with AVP-825. Treatment was well tolerated, with statistically significantly fewer atypical sensations with AVP-825.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare spherical equivalents (SE) and spherical equivalents with cycloplegic (CSE) values of migraine patients with and without visual aura, with those patients without migraine complaints.\n",
      "MATERIAL/METHODS: We included patients over the age of 18 years, who had 20/20 uncorrected vision, and who did not have ocular pathology in their examination. The patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1: 86 eyes of 43 migraine patients without aura, Group 2: 38 eyes of 19 migraine patients with aura, and Group 3: 60 eyes of 30 patients without migraine. Spherical equivalents and spherical equivalents with cycloplegic from the auto-refractometrical values of the patients were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age of the migraine and control patients was 34.2±8.3 and 33.6±10.8 years, respectively. Forty-three (69%) of 62 migraine patients had migraine without aura and 19 (31%) had migraine with aura. The right and left eyes of the patients were evaluated together and a significant correlation was found between the groups. To evaluate the impact of cycloplegia in patients, SE and CSE values were obtained and differences between these values were evaluated. It was found that the change in Group 2 patients was significantly lower than the change in Group 3 patients (p=0.024).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We found that the cycloplegic spherical equivalents values of our patients with aura were lower than control patients. We need further studies to reveal whether migraine with aura is the trigger or the result of those attacks.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ) was developed to assess response to acute treatment in persons with migraine. The original validated form used yes or no response options.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to (1) assess the psychometric properties of a 6-item version of the mTOQ (mTOQ-6) using ordinal response options; (2) compare treatment optimization using the revised mTOQ-6 for both episodic and chronic migraine (EM and CM, respectively); (3) identify demographic, headache, and treatment features associated with treatment optimization.\n",
      "METHODS: The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study is a longitudinal, US population-based study. Annual questionnaires were mailed to a sample of 24,000 severe headache sufferers identified by screening a panel constructed to be representative of the US population. The current study included respondents to the 2006 AMPP Study survey who met modified International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 beta criteria for migraine; persons with CM (≥15 HA days/month) or EM (<15 HA days/month) were included. Acute treatment optimization was measured with the mTOQ-6. A single factor latent variable model was used to assess item characteristics. This model was expanded through structural equation models (SEM) to incorporate a contrast between persons with CM and EM on the scaled treatment optimization scores. We estimated both an unadjusted SEM and a SEM adjusted for demographic features, headache characteristics, and acute treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: Migraine criteria were met by 8612 persons (539 for CM and 8073 for EM) who completed the mTOQ-6 as part of the 2006 AMPP Study survey. When compared, those with CM exhibited worse treatment optimization across all domains of the mTOQ-6. For example, 35.1% of CM and 44.6% of EM respondents reported being pain free at 2 hours \"half the time or more\" with their usual migraine medication. Latent variable model parameters indicated excellent psychometric properties of the mTOQ-6. Scaled treatment optimization scores obtained from the unadjusted SEM were significantly lower (indicating worse treatment optimization) for persons with CM (3.25) compared to persons with EM (4.01), b = -0.76, P < .0001; scores remained significantly lower for CM after adjustment with a wide array of demographic and disease severity covariates. Poor treatment optimization was associated with cutaneous allodynia, major depression, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Better treatment optimization was associated with the use of triptans and preventive medications.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Estimates of the latent variable scores for the mTOQ-6 revealed persistent low levels of treatment optimization for both EM and CM, though treatment optimization is worse for CM.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of greater occipital nerve block (GONB) in patients with primary headache syndromes is controversial. Few studies have been evaluated the usefulness of GONB in patients with migraine without aura (MWOA).\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided GONB using bupivacaine 0.5% and placebo on clinical improvement in patients with refractory MWOA in a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot trial.\n",
      "SETTING: Physical medicine and rehabilitation and neurology departments of a University Hospital.\n",
      "METHODS: Thirty-two patients with a diagnosis of MWOA according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria were included in the study. Twenty-three patients (2 men, 21 women) completed the study. They were randomly assigned to receive either GONB with local anesthetic (bupivacaine 0.5% 1.5 mL) or greater occipital nerve (GON) injection with normal saline (0.9% 1.5 mL). Ultrasound-guided GONB was performed to more accurately locate the nerve. All procedures were performed using a 7 - 13 MHz high-resolution linear ultrasound transducer. The treatment group was comprised of 11 patients and the placebo group was comprised of 12 patients. The primary outcome measure was the change in the headache severity score during the one-month post-intervention period. Headache severity was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense pain).\n",
      "RESULTS: In both groups, a decrease in headache intensity on the injection side was observed during the first post-injection week and continued until the second week. After the second week, the improvement continued in the treatment group, and the VAS score reached 0.97 at the end of the fourth week. In the placebo group after the second week, the VAS values increased again and nearly reached the pre-injection levels. The decrease in the monthly average pain intensity score on the injected side was statistically significant in the treatment group (P = 0.003), but not in the placebo group (P = 0.110). No statistically significant difference in the monthly average pain intensity score was observed on the uninjected side in either group (treatment group, P = 0.994; placebo group, P = 0.987). No serious side effect was observed after the treatment in either group. Only one patient had a self-limited vaso-vagal syncope during the procedure.\n",
      "LIMITATIONS: This trial included a relatively small sample. This may have been the result of the inclusion of only those patients who correctly completed their pain diaries. Another major limitation is the short follow-up duration. Patients were followed for one month after the injection, thus relatively long-term effects of the injection have not been observed.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound guided GONB with 1.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine for the treatment of migraine patients is a safe, simple, and effective technique without severe adverse effects. To increase the effectiveness of the injection, and to implement the isolated GONB, ultrasonography guidance could be suggested.\n",

      "PURPOSE: Lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) plays an important role in jaw movement and has been implicated in Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Migraine has been described as a common symptom in patients with TMDs and may be related to muscle hyperactivity. This study aimed to compare LPM volume in individuals with and without migraine, using segmentation of the LPM in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the TMJ.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with migraine and 20 volunteers without migraine underwent a clinical examination of the TMJ, according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMDs. MR imaging was performed and the LPM was segmented using the ITK-SNAP 1.4.1 software, which calculates the volume of each segmented structure in voxels per cubic millimeter. The chi-squared test and the Fisher's exact test were used to relate the TMD variables obtained from the MR images and clinical examinations to the presence of migraine. Logistic binary regression was used to determine the importance of each factor for predicting the presence of a migraine headache.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients with TMDs and migraine tended to have hypertrophy of the LPM (58.7%). In addition, abnormal mandibular movements (61.2%) and disc displacement (70.0%) were found to be the most common signs in patients with TMDs and migraine.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In patients with TMDs and simultaneous migraine, the LPM tends to be hypertrophic. LPM segmentation on MR imaging may be an alternative method to study this muscle in such patients because the hypertrophic LPM is not always palpable.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: In most of the studies, the association of vascular events is limited to migraine with aura or it is stronger in this group, whereas the link between migraine without aura (MO) and vascular events remained uncertain. Therefore, we decided to evaluate endothelial function by chemical and functional markers of endothelium in MO and compare with normal population.\n",
      "METHODS: In this study, 39 patients and 25 healthy subjects were enrolled and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrite and nitrate were measured in these two groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean of FMD in healthy people was higher than the migraine patients (mean difference - 7.67%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.90--5.44). The means of nitrite concentration in migraineurs was significantly lower than healthy subjects (mean difference - 2.0 μmol/L; 95% CI - 3.45--0.54). But the CRP concentrations in both groups were not significantly different (mean difference 0.42 pmol/L; 95% CI - 0.13-0.98).\n",

Current treatment of a migraine headache consists of multiple medications for control and prevention of recurrent attacks. Global emergence of alternative medicine led us to examine the efficacy of cupping therapy plus serkangabin syrup in the treatment of migraine headaches.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, controlled, open-label, comparative efficacy trial. We randomly assigned patients with migraine into cupping therapy plus serkangabin group (30 patients) and conventional treatment group (30 patients). An investigator assessed the severity of headache, frequency of attacks in a week and duration of attacks per hour in 5 visits (at the end of 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months). Generalized estimating equations approach was used to analyze repeated measures data to compare outcomes in both groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Average age for cupping therapy group and conventional treatment group were 31.7 (±7.6) and 32.6 (±12.7) years, respectively (P = 0.45). After treatment for 2 weeks; and 1, 3 and 6 months, severity of headache (P = 0.80), frequency of migraine attacks (P = 0.63) and duration of attacks per hours (P = 0.48) were similar in conventional and cupping groups but these symptoms were decreased in each group during the study (P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between cupping plus serkangabin therapy and conventional treatment in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine. The alternative therapy may be used in cases of drug intolerance, no medication response, and in primary care.\n",

      "METHODS: Primary open angle glaucoma patients were classified as having UPG or BPG according to an assessment of optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer photographs and visual field analysis. Risk factors including the presence of systemic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, migraine, and dyslipidema) were compared between the UPG and BPG groups. Baseline characteristics and pre- and post-treatment intraocular pressure (IOP) were compared between the progressing eye (PE) and the non-progressing eye (NPE) within the same patient in the UPG group and between the faster progressing eye and the slower progressing eye in the BPG group.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 343 patients (average follow-up period of 4.2 years), 43 were categorized into the UPG group and 31 into the BPG group. The prevalence of all analyzed systemic diseases did not differ between the two groups. PEs in the UPG group had more severe pathology in terms of baseline visual field parameters than NPEs (mean deviation -6.9 ± 5.7 vs. -2.9 ± 3.9 dB, respectively; p < 0.001). However, baseline IOP, mean follow-up IOP, and other clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the PE and the NPE in the UPG group. The progression rate was significantly higher in the faster progressing eye in patients with BPG than in the PE for patients with UPG (-3.43 ± 3.27 vs. -0.70 ± 1.26 dB/yr, respectively; p = 0.014).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the prevalence of systemic diseases between the UPG and BPG groups. Simultaneously bilaterally progressing patients showed much faster progression rates than those with a unilaterally progressing eye.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics of, and food effect on, diclofenac potassium delivered as an oral solution vs an immediate-release tablet.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is the only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved as monotherapy for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 18 years of age or older. It is formulated with potassium bicarbonate as a buffering agent to raise the pH and consequently increase the aqueous solubility of diclofenac in the acidic environment of the stomach following oral administration. The dosage is 50 mg of powdered diclofenac potassium dissolved in 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 mL) of water prior to administration, with dosing time in relation to food intake not specified - this was the case for the pivotal efficacy and safety trials in subjects with acute migraine attacks in which the primary endpoints were achieved. For acute treatment of migraine attacks, rapid onset of pain relief is desirable and is likely related to a rapid appearance of an effective concentration of the drug in the systemic circulation. The rate at which an orally administered drug reaches the blood is affected by both its formulation and the presence of food in the stomach. The present study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of 2 formulations of diclofenac potassium, an immediate-release tablet and an oral solution, and to ascertain the effect of food.\n",
      "METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, single-center, crossover trial in healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomized using computer-generated list to 1:1:1:1 ratio. They received a single 50-mg dose of diclofenac potassium in 4 sequences (ABCD, BADC, CDBA, and DCAB) during each of the 4 treatment periods. The 4 treatments were: A, oral solution fasting; B, tablet fasting; C, oral solution fed; and D, tablet fed. There was a ≥7-day washout period between dosing. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken for up to 12 hours post-dose and analyzed for diclofenac concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including peak concentration (Cmax ), time to Cmax (tmax ), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to last measurable concentration (AUCt ), and extrapolation to infinity (AUC∞ ) were obtained using non-compartmental analysis. Comparative assessments for Cmax and AUC were performed between the solution and tablet under fed and fasting conditions and between fed and fasting states for both formulations. Bioequivalent exposure was defined as the geometric mean ratio and its 90% confidence interval falling within 80.0-125.0% for Cmax and AUC. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the trial.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the 36 randomized subjects were male, 91.7% were Caucasian, and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 31.9 (7.6) years. Thirty-three (91.7%) subjects completed all 4 treatments.\n",
      "SOLUTION VS TABLET: When taken under fed conditions, the oral solution resulted in an approximately 80% faster median tmax (0.17 vs 1.25 hours, P = .00015) and a 21% lower Cmax (mean ± SD, ng/mL: 506 ± 305 vs 835 ± 449, P = .00061) compared with the tablet. AUC values were similar between the 2 formulations. When taken under fasting conditions, the oral solution exhibited a 50% faster median tmax (0.25 vs 0.50 hours, P = .00035) to achieve a 77% higher Cmax (mean ± SD, ng/mL: 1620 ± 538 vs 1160 ± 452, P = .00032) compared with the tablet. AUCt and AUC∞ were similar between the 2 formulations.\n",
      "FED VS FASTING: When taken under fed conditions, the oral solution resulted in a similar median tmax (0.17 vs 0.25 hours, P = .185) and 64% lower Cmax (mean ± SD, ng/mL: 506 ± 305 vs 1620 ± 538, P < .00001) compared with fasting conditions. In comparison, the tablets under fed conditions resulted in a statistically significantly delayed median tmax (1.25 vs 0.50, P = .00143) and ∼30% lower Cmax (mean ± SD, ng/mL: 835 ± 449 vs 1160 ± 452, P = .00377). AUC values were similar between fed and fasting conditions for both formulations. Twelve subjects (33%) experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent AE during the study. All AEs were mild and resolved without treatment; none resulted in study discontinuation. More treatment-emergent AEs were reported in subjects receiving the tablet compared with the solution formulation (20.0% vs 11.8 % in fasting and 17.1% vs 8.6% in fed conditions).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Diclofenac potassium oral solution and tablet formulations produced statistically significantly different Cmax and tmax but similar AUC under fed and fasting conditions. Fed conditions produced significantly lower Cmax for both formulations and profoundly delayed tmax for the tablet, but had no effect on tmax for the solution formulation. These data provide insights into the importance of an earlier and greater exposure to diclofenac arising from the solution formulation than the tablet, which may account for the superiority in the onset and sustained pain reduction for the solution than the tablet formulation observed in the double-blind, efficacy/safety study in migraine patients conducted in Europe.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between migraine and Bell palsy and to examine the effects of age, sex, migraine subtype, and comorbid risk factors for Bell palsy.\n",
      "METHODS: This nationwide cohort study was conducted using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Subjects aged 18 years or older with neurologist-diagnosed migraine from 2005 to 2009 were included. A nonheadache age- and propensity score-matched control cohort was selected for comparison. All subjects were followed until the end of 2010, death, or the occurrence of a Bell palsy event. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals to compare the risk of Bell palsy between groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both cohorts (n = 136,704 each) were followed for a mean of 3.2 years. During the follow-up period, 671 patients (424,372 person-years) in the migraine cohort and 365 matched control subjects (438,677 person-years) were newly diagnosed with Bell palsy (incidence rates, 158.1 and 83.2/100,000 person-years, respectively). The adjusted hazard ratio for Bell palsy was 1.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-2.17; p < 0.001). The association between migraine and Bell palsy remained significant in sensitivity analyses, and tests of interaction failed to reach significance in all subgroup analyses.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Migraine is a previously unidentified risk factor for Bell palsy. The association between these 2 conditions suggests a linked disease mechanism, which is worthy of further exploration.\n",

      "AIM: The aim of this article is to cross-sectionally compare objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels and their association with migraine characteristics in obese women with and without migraine.\n",
      "METHODS: Obese women seeking weight loss treatment were divided into migraine (n = 25) and control (n = 25) groups matched by age and body mass index (BMI). Participants wore the SenseWear Armband monitor for seven days to objectively evaluate daily light-(LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA). Migraine diagnosis was confirmed by a neurologist using ICHD-3-beta criteria. Migraine characteristics were tracked daily using a smartphone-based diary over a four-week period immediately preceding the objective PA assessment.\n",
      "RESULTS: Migraine participants spent 57.9 fewer minutes/day in LPA (141.1 ± 56.4 vs. 199.1 ± 87.7, p = 0.019) and 24.5 fewer minutes/day in MVPA (27.8 ± 17.0 vs. 52.3 ± 26.0, p < 0.001), compared to controls. Migraine participants reported 4.8 ± 3.1 migraine days/month (mean duration = 17.1 ± 8.9 hours; mean maximum pain severity = 6.4 ± 1.7 on a 0-10 scale). Higher BMI (p < 0.05), but not migraine characteristics, were related to lower total PA. Additionally, total objectively measured PA was not associated with how often PA was reported to exacerbate migraine attacks during the four-week diary assessment.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Obese women with migraine spent nearly 1.5 hours/day less in PA compared to controls; however, lower PA was not related to migraine characteristics. Further research is needed to identify PA barriers and effective interventions in obese women with migraine.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been associated with paradoxical embolism leading to stroke/transient ischemic attack, migraine, and neurological decompression sickness. In search for the optimal device that would achieve effective clinical closure with minimal complications, a better device selection based on PFO anatomy and improvements in device design is needed. The Flatstent is a new device designed to treat the highly prevalent long-tunnel PFOs from within, minimizing the amount of material left behind in an attempt to reduce device-related complications. The objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of the novel Flatstent versus the conventional umbrella devices in the transcatheter closure of PFO in a nonrandomized, retrospective, single-center study.\n",
      "METHODS: Between March 2010 and March 2013, 88 patients underwent PFO closure at The Heart Hospital, London with either the novel Flatstent or one of the four conventionally used umbrella devices (GORE Helex Septal Occluder, Occlutech Figulla Flex, Biostar Septal Occluder, and Amplatzer PFO Occluder) depending on their PFO anatomy. Patients were then evaluated with contrast transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) at 6 weeks and 1 year after the procedure. The residual shunt and complication rates between the Flatstent and umbrella devices were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: The Flatstent was used in 27 patients (30.7%), whereas 61 patients (69.3%) received one of the four umbrella devices. Primary efficacy point of clinical closure defined as grade 0 or grade 1; residual shunt was achieved in 81.3% in the Flatstent cohort and 80.3% in the umbrella device group at 6 weeks follow-up. At 1 year, the clinical closure rates reached 92.6 and 91.8%. There were two device embolizations, one in each cohort during the immediate postoperative period (<24 hrs), with successful retrieval. One patient in the umbrella device group developed transient atrial fibrillation, which was controlled medically. Event recurrence rate was 0% at 1 year.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: No difference was found in closure or complication rates between the Flatstent and the umbrella devices. With appropriate preassessment of the PFO anatomy, the Flatstent works as a safe and effective method of treating the PFO from within the tunnel, especially in those with long-tunnel PFOs. Longer follow-up is needed to establish superiority.\n",

      "METHODS: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of a nationally representative sample of the resident (citizens and permanent residents) population in Singapore. The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were established using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Index scores were derived using the Singapore preference weights.\n",
      "RESULTS: In general, the mean EQ-5D index score using Singapore preference weights decreased with increased age. The EQ-5D Malay version reported lower mean EQ-5D index than the English version. In multivariate analysis, the mean EQ-5D index for respondents with MDD, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, GAD, OCD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, neurological condition, stroke or major paralysis, heart attack, back problems, stomach ulcer, kidney failure, migraine headaches, and chronic lung disease was significantly lower than those without these conditions.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This study aims to measure olfactory acuity in chronic migraine subjects, at baseline and on migraine days, and compare to age- and sex-matched controls. Olfactory impairment is common in neurological disorders. While smell hypersensitivity has been established with chronic migraine, olfactory acuity has not been well studied.\n",
      "METHODS: We recruited 50 subjects with chronic migraine from the Jefferson Headache Center and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a validated test of olfaction, olfactory acuity was measured at baseline and during a migraine for subjects, and compared to controls at baseline and at home 2 weeks later. All subjects were additionally screened for odor sensitivity and allodynia.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score for migraine subjects was 34.5 on non-migraine days and 34.7 on migraine days (mean difference=-0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI; -1.3, 0.6] P=.45). Controls had a mean of 35.9 and 36.1 for each test day (mean difference = -0.1, 95% CI [-0.9, 0.7] P=.87). On average, migraineurs performed worse than their matched control counterparts in both test sittings (test 1: P=.047; test 2: P=.01). The great majority of subjects were allodynic (42/50) compared with only 9 of 50 controls, and the majority of subjects (41/50) found more than one listed odor to be bothersome, compared with only 10/50 controls. On non-migraine days, 18/48 chronic migraine subjects had abnormal olfaction and on migraine days 14/42 had abnormal olfaction, compared with only 9/50 controls who had abnormal olfaction on their first UPSIT.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: While chronic migraine patients do not appear to have a significant change in olfactory acuity between migrainous and non-migrainous periods, they do appear to be more likely to have abnormal olfactory acuity at baseline compared to age- and sex-matched controls.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Common neurological syndrome (migraine without aura) is more common among women than men. Migraine is among the top 20 causes of disability. Menstruation is known to be a powerful trigger for migraine, and so is stress, but the presentation of headache is similar in both. Also, women are more vulnerable to stress as well as migraine, and this makes a complex relationship of menstruation, stress, and migraine.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study was done to understand the association of hormonal fluctuation in menstruation and stress with common migraine.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in 40 young adult females, of whom 20 participants were cases of migraine without aura (18-35 years old), and the remaining 20 participants were age-matched controls. The study was done in Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. Study participants were selected on the basis of International Headache Society (ICHD-IIA1.1) (2004) classification. Study participants with neurological disorders, chronic diseases, and disease suggestive of any hormonal disturbances were excluded. Clinically diagnosed migraine cases were asked to maintain a headache diary and to fill in the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales questionnaire. Biochemical assessment of hormonal status for thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, estrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin was also done on the second day of their menstrual cycle. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare hormonal levels and the χ (2) test to compare anxiety- or depression-related stress among the migraine and nonmigraine groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Significantly higher values of prolactin were observed in cases (mean ± standard deviation, 152.7 mIU/L±30.5) compared to controls (76.1 mIU/L±8.7), with a P-value <0.001. There was no statistically significant difference observed in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (P=0.081), estrogen (P=0.086), luteinizing hormone (P=0.091), or follicle-stimulating hormone (P=0.478). Also, anxiety with stress or depression with stress was significantly higher among the migraine group than the controls (P=0.002). Odds of any stress in migraine were higher in the migraine group than in the nonmigraine group (odds ratio 12, 95% confidence interval 2.7-53.33).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Migraine, particularly without aura, in women is mainly associated with stress-related anxiety or depression, and are more susceptible to stress in the premenstrual period.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Many acute primary headache patients are not diagnosed with a specific headache type and are treated with opiates and nonspecific pain medications in the ED setting. This is inconsistent with multiple expert recommendations.\n",
      "METHODS: Electronic charts were reviewed from 574 consecutive patients who visited the ED for acute primary headache (identified by chief complaint and ICD9 codes) and were treated with parenteral medications.\n",
      "RESULTS: Non-opiate recommended headache medications were given first line to 52.6% and opiates to 22.8% of all participants. Patients given opiates first had significantly longer length of stays (median 5.0 vs. 3.9 hours, p < 0.001) and higher rates of return ED visits within seven days (7.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.033) compared with those given non-opiate recommended medications in univariate analysis.

      "OBJECTIVE: To determine if repetitive sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blocks with 0.5% bupivacaine delivered through the Tx360(®) are superior in reducing pain associated with chronic migraine (CM) compared with saline.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The SPG is a small concentrated structure of neuronal tissue that resides within the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) in close proximity to the sphenopalatine foramen and is innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. From an anatomical and physiological perspective, SPG blockade may be an effective acute and preventative treatment for CM.\n",
      "METHOD: This was a double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot study using a novel intervention for acute treatment in CM. Up to 41 subjects could be enrolled at 2 headache specialty clinics in the US. Eligible subjects were between 18 and 80 years of age and had a history of CM defined by the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders appendix definition. They were allowed a stable dose of migraine preventive medications that was maintained throughout the study. Following a 28-day baseline period, subjects were randomized by computer-generated lists of 2:1 to receive 0.5% bupivacaine or saline, respectively. The primary end-point was to compare numeric rating scale scores at pretreatment baseline vs 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 24 hours postprocedure for all 12 treatments. SPG blockade was accomplished with the Tx360(®) , which allows a small flexible soft plastic tube that is advanced below the middle turbinate just past the pterygopalatine fossa into the intranasal space. A 0.3 cc of anesthetic or saline was injected into the mucosa covering the SPG. The procedure is performed similarly in each nostril. The active phase of the study consisted of a series of 12 SPG blocks with 0.3 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine or saline provided 2 times per week for 6 weeks. Subjects were re-evaluated at 1 and 6 months postfinal procedure.\n",
      "RESULTS: The final dataset included 38 subjects, 26 in the bupivacaine group and 12 in the saline group. A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that subjects receiving treatment with bupivacaine experienced a significant reduction in the numeric rating scale scores compared with those receiving saline at baseline (M=3.78 vs M=3.18, P=.10), 15 minutes (M=3.51 vs M=2.53, P<.001), 30 minutes (M=3.45 vs M=2.41, P<.001), and 24 hours after treatment (M=4.20 vs M=2.85, P<.001), respectively. Headache Impact Test-6 scores were statistically significantly decreased in subjects receiving treatments with bupivacaine from before treatment to the final treatment (Mdiff  = -4.52, P=.005), whereas no significant change was seen in the saline group (Mdiff  = -1.50, P=.13).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: SPG blockade with bupivacaine delivered repetitively for 6 weeks with the Tx360(®) device demonstrates promise as an acute treatment of headache in some subjects with CM. Statistically significant headache relief is noted at 15 and 30 minutes and sustained at 24 hours for SPG blockade with bupivacaine vs saline. The Tx360(®) device was simple to use and not associated with any significant or lasting adverse events. Further research on sphenopalatine ganglion blockade is warranted.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of magnesium sulfate and combined use of dexamethasone/metoclopramide on relieving acute migraine headache.\n",
      "METHODS: We randomly divided 70 patients who had been referred to an emergency department, into two equal treatment groups with the two treatment plans, and analyzed pain severity at baseline using a numeric rating scale (NRS). We gave dexamethasone/metoclopramide to one group and magnesium sulfate to the other group, and evaluated pain severity at 20 min and at 1- and 2-h intervals after infusion. Finally, we used repeated-measure and two-way analysis of variance for intra- and inter-group evaluations of pain severity and complications, respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found no significant differences in demographic data and pain severity at baseline (8.2 vs. 8.0) between the two groups (p < 0.05). In the dexamethasone/metoclopramide group, pain severity (mean ± standard deviation) was 7.4 ± 1.4 (p = 0.36), 6.0 ± 2.4, and 2.5 ± 2.9 (p < 0.0001) at 20-min, 1-h, and 2-h intervals after treatment, respectively, with statistically significant differences between the baseline values and 1-h and 2-h interval values. Administration of magnesium sulfate was associated with decreased pain severity at the three intervals (5.2 ± 1.7, 2.3 ± 1.9, and 1.3 ± 0.66, respectively), exhibiting significant differences compared to baseline values and the corresponding time intervals in the dexamethasone/metoclopramide group (p < 0.0001).\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to compare the diagnosis of menstrual migraine without aura (MM) from a clinical interview with prospective headache diaries in a population-based study.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 237 women with self-reported migraine in at least half of menstruations were interviewed by a neurologist about headache and diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders II (ICHD II). Additionally, the MM criteria were expanded to include other types of migraine related to menstruation. Subsequently, all women were asked to complete three month prospective headache diaries.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 123 (52%) women completed both clinical interview and diaries. Thirty-eight women were excluded from the analyses: Two had incomplete diaries and 36 women recorded ≤1 menstruation, leaving 85 diaries eligible for analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and Kappa for the diagnosis of MM in clinical interview vs. headache diary were 82%, 83%, 90%, 71% and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.79). Using a broader definition of MM, Kappa was 0.64 (95% CI 0.47-0.83).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: A thorough clinical interview is valid for the diagnosis of MM. When this is undertaken, prospective headache diaries should not be mandatory to diagnose MM but may be necessary to exclude a chance association.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Triptans are a family of selective serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonists that are widely used to treat acute migraine attacks. Their efficacy is limited by side effects and the gastrointestinal manifestations of migraine.\n",
      "AIM: To compare the efficacy of a single intravenous administration of propacetamol, a prodrug of paracetamol (acetaminophen) with a single dose of oral rizatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients were selected from those who presented to the emergency room with a diagnosed migraine attack and who had not previously taken any analgesics. They were randomized into 2 groups: treatment with a single 1g IV dose of propacetamol or with a single oral dose of 5mg rizatriptan. Their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were assessed before and at 30, 60, and 120min after treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: The patients who received the propacetamol had significantly improved VAS scores at 60min compared to the rizatriptan group. There were no significant differences in VAS scores at 30 or 120min post-treatment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Propacetamol is either equivalent or superior in efficacy to rizatriptan for treating acute migraine attacks, while having the advantage of parenteral administration in patients whose migraines are accompanied by nausea and vomiting.\n",

      "AIMS: Alcohol hangover is a poorly understood cluster of symptoms occurring following a heavy consumption of alcohol. The term \"delayed alcohol-induced headache\" is often used synonymously. Our objective was to compare alcohol hangover symptoms in migraine sufferers and nonsufferers.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, university students were asked to fill structured questionnaires assessing headache history, alcoholic consumption, and hangover symptoms (using the Hangover Symptom Scale (HSS)). Subjects were classified as suffering from migraine with or without aura and nonsufferers according the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2(nd) Edition (ICHD-II). The 13 hangover symptoms were divided by the researches into migraine-like and other nonmigraine-like symptoms.\n",
      "RESULTS: Hangover symptoms among 95 migraine sufferers and 597 nonsufferers were compared. Migraine sufferers consumed less alcohol compared with the nonsufferers (mean drinks/week 2.34 ± 4.11 vs. 2.92 ± 3.58, P = 0.038) and suffered from higher tendency to migraine-like symptoms after drinking (mean 2.91 ± 3.43 vs. 1.85 ± 2.35, P = 0.002) but not to other hangover symptoms (mean 5.39 ± 6.31 vs. 4.34 ± 4.56, P = 0.1).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Migraine sufferers consume less alcohol, especially beer and liquors, and are more vulnerable to migraine-like hangover symptoms than nonsufferers. The finding that the tendency to develop migraine attacks affects the hangover symptomatology may suggest a similarity in pathophysiology, and possibly in treatment options.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Published data from 1998 revealed that most patients treated for migraine in an emergency department received opioids. Over the intervening years, a large body of evidence has emerged demonstrating the efficacy and safety of non-opioid alternatives. Expert opinion during these years has cautioned against use of opioids for migraine. Our objectives were to compare current frequency of use of various medications for acute migraine in US emergency departments with use of these same medications in 1998 and to identify factors independently associated with opioid use.\n",
      "METHODS: We analyzed National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 2010, the most current dataset available. The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is a public dataset collected and distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is a multi-stage probability sample from randomly selected emergency departments across the country, designed to be representative of all US emergency department visits. We included in our analysis all patients with the ICD9 emergency department discharge diagnosis of migraine. We tabulated frequency of use of specific medications in 2010 and compared these results with the 1998 data. Using a logistic regression model, into which all of the following variables were entered, we explored the independent association between any opioid use in 2010 and sex, age, race/ethnicity, geographic region, type of hospital, triage pain score and history of emergency department use within the previous 12 months.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 2010, there were 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.9, 1.4) million migraine visits to US emergency departments. Including opioid-containing oral analgesic combinations, opioids were administered in 59% of visits (95% confidence interval 51, 67). The most commonly used parenteral agent, hydromorphone, was used in 25% (95% confidence interval 19, 33) of visits in 2010 versus less than 1% (95% confidence interval 0, 3) in 1998. Conversely, use of meperidine had decreased markedly over the same timeframe. In 2010, it was used in just 7% (95% confidence interval 4, 12) of visits compared to 37% (95% confidence interval 29, 45) in 1998. Metoclopramide, the most commonly used anti-dopaminergic, was administered in 17% (95% confidence interval 12, 23) of visits in 2010 and 3% (95% confidence interval 1, 6) of visits in 1998. Use of any triptan was relatively uncommon in 2010 (7% (95% confidence interval 4, 11) of visits) and in 1998 (10% (95% confidence interval 6, 15) of visits). Of the predictor variables listed above, only emergency department use within the previous 12 months was associated with opioid administration (adjusted odds ratio: 2.87 (95% confidence interval 1.03, 7.97)).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In spite of recommendations to the contrary, opioids are still used in more than half of all emergency department visits for migraine. Though use of meperidine has decreased markedly between 1998 and 2010, it has largely been replaced by hydromorphone. Opioid use in migraine visits is independently associated with prior visits to the same emergency department in the previous 12 months.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder and any interventions improving endothelial function may contribute to its treatment and prevention of vascular complications like ischemic stroke. Yoga has been shown to have several beneficial effects on cardiovascular systems. However, no randomized controlled studies to date have investigated its effects on endothelial function of migraineurs.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 42 women patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into either a Yoga exercise group or a control group. The control group received only medication for 12 weeks and the Yoga group was placed in yoga training program in addition to the same medical treatment. Blood test was given from all patients in order to measure plasma levels intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) after yoga training program.\n",
      "RESULTS: Totally 32 patients were participated in the final analyses (yoga: n = 18, control: n = 14). By analyzing data between yoga and control groups after the treatment period, there was a significant decreased in plasma level of VCAM in yoga group compare with the control group (15.29 ± 2.1 ng/ml vs. 21.70 ± 3.0 ng/ml, P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in ICAM level between groups (19.1 ± 1.8 ng/ml vs. 20.97 ± 1.9 ng/ml P > 0.05).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The PedMIDAS is the only instrument validated to assess migraine disability among school-aged children. However, the PedMIDAS may underestimate disability during prolonged school holidays.\n",
      "METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, migraine patients aged 10-18 years completed a 90-day Internet-based headache diary. For each headache day, they answered PedMIDAS-based questions and rated their headache intensity (scale 1-10). PedMIDAS-based scores, headache intensity ratings, and relative headache frequencies were compared for school days vs non-school days and for the school year vs the summer holiday.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-two patients completed 4680 diary entries comprising 984 headache days. The headache frequencies and intensity ratings did not differ between time periods. However, the mean headache disability scores (as measured from PedMIDAS-based questions) were significantly different for school days (0.85) compared to non-school days (0.45), P < .001, and for the school year (0.73) compared to the summer holiday (0.46), P < .016.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Given similar headache intensities and frequencies, daily PedMIDAS-based scores significantly underestimate headache disability on non-school days. Accordingly, PedMIDAS scoring during the school year may not be comparable to assessments done during the summer holiday. These potential differences must be considered when using the instrument as an outcome measure for clinical trials.\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of BTX-A on the immunoreactive levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in the jugular plasma and medulla oblongata of migraine in rats induced by nitroglycerin (NTG), and then to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of fixed (muscle)-sites and acupoint-sites injection of BTX-A for migraine therapy of patients in a randomly controlled trial extending over four months.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats with NTG-induced migraine were subcutaneously injected with vehicle or BTX-A (5 U/kg or 10 U/kg bodyweight). CGRP- and SP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI and SP-LI) were determined by radioimmunoassay. In clinical trials, sixty patients respectively received BTX-A (2.5 U each site, 25 U per patient) at fixed-sites (group F, n = 30) including occipitofrontalis, corrugator supercili, temporalis and trapezius or at acupoint-sites (group A, n = 30) including EX-HN3, EX-HN5, GV20, GB8, GB20 and BL10.\n",
      "RESULTS: Local BTX-A injection suppressed NTG-induced CGRP-LI and SP-LI levels in jugular plasma and oblongata. BTX-A injection for both groups with migraine significantly reduced the attack frequency, intensity, duration and associated symptoms. The efficacy of BTX-A for migraine in group A (93% improvement) was more significant than that in group F (83% improvement) (P < 0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The evidence that BTX-A decreases NTG-induced CGRP-LI and SP-LI levels in trigeminovascular system suggests that BTX-A attenuates migraine by suppression of neuropeptide release. BTX-A injections for migraine at acupoint-sites and fixed-sites are effective. Acupoint-sites BTX-A administration shows more efficacy for migraine than fixed-sites application.\n",

      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of 45 children with a primary complaint of chronic nausea several times per week. Comparisons were made to prospectively collected data on 49 children with functional abdominal pain and comorbid nausea.\n",
      "RESULTS: The majority of those affected were adolescent Caucasian females. Subjects with chronic nausea had a more severe presentation with daily 88% (vs 26%) and constant 60% (vs 10%) nausea (P < .001), one-half with peak morning intensity. In the chronic nausea group, 62% had migraines, and 71% (vs 22%) had familial migraines (P < .001), 36% had postural tachycardia syndrome and 27% cyclic vomiting syndrome.

Patients with primary (vs secondary) chronic nausea were more likely Caucasian, older adolescent females with severe, daily nausea and comorbid conditions such as anxiety, dizziness, and fatigue as well as significantly more migraine features. Chronic nausea is a major, disabling symptom that requires increased recognition as a separate functional entity.

It is unclear how knowledgeable triptan users are regarding their triptan, how much education occurs when triptans are prescribed, and the impact patient education has on actual patient knowledge regarding triptan use.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare triptan users' self-perceived knowledge and actual knowledge about triptans in patients who report having received triptan education vs patients who report not having received triptan education.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective observational study of 207 migraine patients who were using triptans for abortive therapy and who were being evaluated as new patients at academic headache specialty clinics in the United States. Patients completed standardized questionnaires regarding their self-perceived knowledge about triptans, their actual knowledge regarding triptans, and the perceived education about the triptan that they had received at the time of prescription.\n",
      "RESULTS: Although greater than 80% of the subjects reported receiving education about when to take the triptan and the number of doses they could take for headache, only 71.5% reported receiving education about triptan side effects, 64% for the number of triptan doses they could take each week/month, 64% for taking other medications with the triptan, and 49% for medical contraindications to triptan use. Compared with subjects who did not recall receiving education about when to take their triptan, subjects who recalled such education had a statistically significant greater actual knowledge for taking the triptan immediately after a headache begins (91% vs 77%, P = .049; confidence interval [CI]: 0.00-0.33), treating when pain is mild (75% vs 50%, P = .009; CI: 0.04-0.45), understanding that they do not need to fail treatment with over-the-counter medications before taking a triptan (74% vs 42%, P = .001; CI: 0.11-0.51), and recognizing that coronary artery disease is a contraindication to triptan use (40% vs 19%, P = .001; CI: 0.09-0.34).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that patients who recall having received education at the time of triptan prescribing have greater knowledge regarding optimal triptan use. Triptan users who recalled having received this education had greater recognition of the importance of taking the triptan immediately at the onset of a headache, treating when pain is mild, not needing to fail treatment with over-the-counter medications before taking a triptan, and understanding that coronary artery disease is a contraindication to triptan use.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the treatment failure rate of chlorpromazine in the treatment of migraine headache in youth presenting to the PED with those who received prochlorperazine; and (2) to identify the frequency and type of adverse events, and change in pain score.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients 12-21 years of age treated for migraine headache in our emergency department. Our treatment group received intravenous chlorpromazine between February and April 2012, while the comparison group consisted of children treated with intravenous prochlorperazine between February and April 2011. The outcomes of interest were: (1) treatment failure, defined as need for additional therapy, hospitalization or 48-hour return; (2) adverse reactions to drug therapy; and (3) change in pain score.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study yielded 75 patients in the treatment group and 274 in the comparison group. Forty percent (30/75) of the treatment group had treatment failure compared with 15% (41/274) of the comparison group. There was no difference in mean change in pain score between the groups. The most common adverse effects included hypotension in the treatment group (12%) and akathisia in the comparison group (12%).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that has examined the use of chlorpromazine as a therapy in pediatric migraines. Abortive therapy for migraine headache in the PED with chlorpromazine is associated with greater need for rescue medication and hospitalization, and higher rates of hypotension.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: To compare health care utilization of duloxetine initiators and pregabalin initiators among fibromyalgia patients in a real-world setting.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on a US national commercial health claims database (2006-2009). Fibromyalgia patients who initiated duloxetine or pregabalin in 2008, aged 18-64 years, and who maintained continuous health insurance coverage 1 year before and 1 year after initiation were assigned to duloxetine or pregabalin cohorts on the basis of their initiated agent. Patients who had pill coverage of the agents over the course of 90 days preceding the initiation were excluded. The two comparative cohorts were constructed using propensity score greedy match methods. Descriptive analysis and paired t-test were performed to compare health care utilization rates in the postinitiation year and the changes of these rates from the preinitiation year to the postinitiation year.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both matched cohorts (n=1,265 pairs) had a similar mean initiation age (49-50 years), percentage of women (87%-88%), and prevalence of baseline comorbid conditions (neuropathic pain other than diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, low back pain, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, headache or migraine, and osteoarthritis). In the preinitiation year, both cohorts had similar inpatient, outpatient, and medication utilization rates (inpatient, 15.7%-16.1%; outpatient, 100.0%; medication, 97.9%-98.7%). The utilization rates diverged in the postinitiation year, with the pregabalin cohort using more fibromyalgia-related inpatient care (3.2% versus 2.2%; P<0.05), any inpatient care (19.3% versus 16.8%; P<0.05), and fibromyalgia-related outpatient care (62.1% versus 51.8%; P<0.05). From the preinitiation period to the postinitiation period, the duloxetine cohort experienced decreases in certain utilization rates, whereas the pregabalin cohort had increases (percentage of patients with a fibromyalgia-related admission, -1.2% versus 0.4% [P<0.01]; number of fibromyalgia-related outpatient claims, -1.7 versus 4.7 [P<0.01]).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Fibromyalgia patients initiating pregabalin tended to consume more fibromyalgia-related inpatient and outpatient care in the first postinitiation year, whereas fibromyalgia patients initiating duloxetine tended to have lower utilization rates of fibromyalgia-related inpatient care in the postinitiation year than in the preinitiation year.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Chronic migraine (CM) is a complication of episodic migraine, favored by risk factors as medication overuse (MO). We intend to compare demographic and clinic characteristics of a series of CM patients, with and without MO.\n",
      "METHODS: The study included patients with CM (2006 revised criteria) attended in a headache outpatient office located in a tertiary hospital between January 2008 and May 2012. We recorded demographic characteristics, age at migraine onset, time from onset, previous use of symptomatic or preventive therapy, and headache impact measured with six-item headache impact test (HIT-6).\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 434 patients (357 women, 77 men) were diagnosed with CM out of the 1868 (23.2%) that attended our clinic. Of these, 258 (72.2%) fulfilled criteria of MO, and 59.8% of those with MO, and 41.1% of cases without MO had previously received preventative treatment (P<.001). Age at onset of migraine was lower in MO patients (21.2±10.1 vs 23.8±12.5 years, P=.02) and time from onset to headache clinic consultation was higher in MO cases (23.8±14.1 vs 18.3±14.8 years, P<.001). We found no difference between both groups in average HIT-6 score and the percentage of patients with a HIT-6 score over 55.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: CM, with or without MO, is a burdensome group of patients in our headache clinic. Patients with MO are referred later and have more frequently received preventive treatments.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Migraine is a common form of headache that is a major burden for patients who often seek emergency care. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (dexketoprofen) with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the treatment of an acute migraine attack.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomised, double blind, controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care emergency unit. Study patients were randomised into two groups to receive either 50 mg of dexketoprofen trometamol or 1000 mg of paracetamol intravenously by rapid infusion in 150 mL of normal saline. Pain reduction was measured at baseline, and after 15 and 30 min, using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)) as the primary outcome. VAS is a measurement tool ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain).\n",
      "RESULTS: 200 patients were included in the final analysis. Mean (SD) age of the study subjects was 30.1 ± 11 years and 81% (n=162) were women. Median reduction in VAS score at 30 min was 56 (IQR 30-78.5) for the paracetamol group and 55 (IQR 34-75) for the dexketoprofen group, with a difference of 1 mm (95% CI -7 to 10) between the two groups.\n",

The aim of this study was to compare intravenous (IV) metoclopramide with subcutaneous (SC) sumatriptan in treatment of migraine headache.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial study, patients presenting to the university referral emergency department with acute benign headache were allocated into two groups after obtaining their informed consent. Patients received 20 mg of IV metoclopramide or 6 mg of SC sumatriptan. Pain intensity was assessed with 10-cm visual analog scale at baseline and 60 min after treatment.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four subjects participated. The mean age was 34.9 ± 9 years in metoclopramide group and 26.8 ± 4 years in sumatriptan group (P < 0.0001). The baseline pain scores were 6.47 ± 0.84 and 6.12 ± 0.73 in metoclopramide and sumatriptan groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). The mean of pain score decreased to 0.66 ± 0.59 cm (P < 0.0001) in the metoclopramide group and 1.1 ± 0.70 (P < 0.0001) in the sumatriptan group. Comparison of these two groups showed more pain reduction in the metoclopramide group, with a mean difference of 0.55 ± 0.13 between the groups (95% CI: 0.25-0.79 cm) (P < 0.0001).\n",

The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effect of Yamamoto new scalp acupuncture (YNSA), a recently developed microcupuncture system, with TCA for the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headache.\n",
      "METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with migraine headache were assigned to receive YNSA or TCA.

      "RESULTS: All the recruited patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Frequency and severity of migraine attacks, nausea, the need for rescue treatment, and work absence rate decreased similarly in both groups. Recovery from headache and ability to continue daily activities 2 hours after medical treatment showed similar improvement in both groups (p>0.05).\n",

    "### Konzept für Quality Checks von LLM-Antworten zu Medical Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Um sicherzustellen, dass die Antworten eines Large Language Models (LLM) wie LLaMa3 korrekt und zuverlässig sind, wenn es um medizinische Aufzeichnungen geht, ist ein strukturiertes Qualitätskontrollverfahren erforderlich. Dieses Verfahren muss verschiedene Aspekte der Genauigkeit, Relevanz und Konsistenz der Antworten bewerten. Hier sind einige Konzepte und Ideen für die Durchführung dieser Qualitätskontrollen:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Definieren der Qualitätskriterien\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitätskriterien sollten klar definiert sein und könnten die folgenden beinhalten:\n",
    "- Korrektheit der Informationen: Übereinstimmung der Antworten mit den medizinischen Aufzeichnungen.\n",
    "- Vollständigkeit: Die Antwort sollte alle wesentlichen Informationen enthalten.\n",
    "- Konsistenz: Konsistente Antworten bei wiederholten Anfragen oder ähnlichen Fällen.\n",
    "- Verständlichkeit: Die Antwort sollte klar und verständlich formuliert sein.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Automatisierte Überprüfung\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatisierte Tools können verwendet werden, um die LLM-Antworten gegen eine Datenbank von validierten medizinischen Informationen zu überprüfen:\n",
    "- Vergleich mit einer referenziellen Datenbank: Antworten werden mit bestehenden, verifizierten medizinischen Datensätzen abgeglichen.\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Algorithmen: Einsatz von NLP-Algorithmen (wie TF-IDF oder BERT), um semantische Übereinstimmungen und Abweichungen zu identifizieren.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Menschliche Überprüfung\n",
    "\n",
    "Menschliche Überprüfung ist entscheidend, um sicherzustellen, dass die Antworten korrekt sind:\n",
    "- Manuelle Überprüfung: Ein Mensch bewertet die Antworten hinsichtlich ihrer Genauigkeit, in dem die echten Daten gelesen und verglichen werden.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Testfälle und Szenarien\n",
    "\n",
    "Erstellung von Testfällen und Szenarien, die typische und atypische medizinische Fälle abdecken:\n",
    "- Synthetische Datensätze: Generierung von synthetischen, aber realistischen medizinischen Datensätzen zur Bewertung.\n",
    "- Edge-Cases: Einbeziehung von seltenen, komplexen und unrealistischen Fällen, um die Robustheit des Modells zu testen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Metriken und KPIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Metriken und KPIs zur Messung der Leistung des Modells:\n",
    "- Genauigkeit bzw. Accuracy: Anteil der richtig getroffenen Antworten"
