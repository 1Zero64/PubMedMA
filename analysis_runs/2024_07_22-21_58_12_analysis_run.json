Patients with ≥4 migraine days per month and naïve to study drugs were randomly assigned (1:1) to either subcutaneous erenumab (70 or 140 mg/month) plus topiramate placebo (erenumab group) or oral topiramate at the individual dose with optimal efficacy (50-100 mg/day) plus erenumab placebo (topiramate group).The primary endpoint was medication discontinuation due to an adverse event during the double-blind phase. The proportion of patients that achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days during the last 3 months of the double-blind phase was a secondary endpoint.\nRESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy-seven patients were randomised (from 22 February 2019 to 29 July, 2020) and 95.1% completed the study. In the erenumab group, 10.6% discontinued medication due to adverse events compared to 38.9% in the topiramate group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.27; p &lt; 0.001).

Using two large electronic health records-based datasets, we examined stroke risk differences between migraine patients with- and without- documented use of propranolol.\nMETHODS: This retrospective case-control study utilized EHR data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us Research Program. Migraine patients were first identified based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria using diagnosis codes. Among these patients, cases were defined as those with a primary diagnosis of stroke following the first diagnosis of migraine, while controls had no stroke after their first migraine diagnosis. Logistic regression models, adjusted for potential factors associated with stroke risk, assessed the association between propranolol use and stroke risk, stratified by sex and migraine subtype. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for stroke risk at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years from baseline.\nRESULTS: In the VUMC database, 378 cases and 15,209 controls were identified, while the All of Us database included 267 cases and 6,579 controls. Propranolol significantly reduced stroke risk in female migraine patients (VUMC: OR=0.52, p=0.006; All of Us: OR=0.39, p=0.007), but not in males. The effect was more pronounced for ischemic stroke and in females with migraines without aura (MO) (VUMC: OR=0.60, p=0.014; All of Us: OR=0.28, p=0.006). The Cox model showed lower stroke rates in propranolol-treated female migraine patients at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years (VUMC: HR=0.06-0.55, p=0.0018-0.085; All of Us: HR=0.23, p=0.045 at 10 years).\nCONCLUSIONS: Propranolol is associated with a significant reduction in stroke risk, particularly ischemic stroke, among female migraine without aura patients.

This study aims to assess the safety profile and efficacy of BoNTA in CM after 5 years of treatment in a real-life setting.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with CM in relation to BoNTA treatment for more than 5 years in 19 Spanish headache clinics. We excluded patients who discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability.\nRESULTS: 489 patients were included [mean age 49, 82.8% women]. The mean age of onset of migraine was 21.8 years; patients had CM with a mean of 6.4 years (20.8% fulfilled the aura criteria). At baseline, patients reported a mean of 24.7 monthly headache days (MHDs) and 15.7 monthly migraine days (MMDs). In relation to effectiveness, the responder rate was 59.1% and the mean reduction in MMDs was 9.4 days (15.7 to 6.3 days; p &lt; 0.001). The MHDs were also reduced by 14.9 days (24.7 to 9.8 days; p &lt; 0.001). Regarding the side effects, 17.5% experienced neck pain, 17.3% headache, 8.5% eyelid ptosis, 7.5% temporal muscle atrophy and 3.2% trapezius muscle atrophy. Furthermore, after longer-term exposure exceeding 5 years, there were no serious adverse events (AE) or treatment discontinuation because of safety or tolerability issues.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with BoNTA led to sustained reductions in migraine frequency, even after long-term exposure exceeding 5 years, with no evidence of new safety concerns.",

Overall, the mean (SD) MMD change from baseline showed sustained improvement over 3 years (-4.4 [3.9] days at week 168). The most common treatment-emergent AEs (per 100 person-years) were nasopharyngitis (28.8), influenza (7.5), and back pain (5.8). Overall, 9.6% (3.9 per 100 person-years) and 6.7% (2.7 per 100 person-years) of participants reported events of treatment-emergent hypertension and constipation, respectively.

The results have been presented after 3 years of erenumab exposure in its open-label extension phase (OLEP).\nMETHODS: Participants completing the 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP) of the LIBERTY study could enter the OLEP and receive 140 mg of erenumab once monthly for 3 years. The main outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs), the mean MMD change from baseline, and tolerability and safety.\nRESULTS: Overall, 240/246 (97.6%) participants entered the OLEP and 168/240 (70.0%) completed the study (85/118 continuing erenumab [n = 1 lost during follow-up]; 83/122 switching from placebo [n = 2 lost during follow-up]). In the overall population, 79/151 participants (52.3%) with valid data points achieved ≥50% reduction in MMDs at week 168 (i.e., responders).

It has been proven to be safe and efficacious in patients with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) as demonstrated in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials including patients from Europe, Japan, and the United States. Reversion from CM to EM, as indicated by a reduction in the frequency of headache days, is an important indicator for efficacy outcome, though it has not been analyzed widely in patients with CM to date.\nOBJECTIVE: Primary results of the DRAGON study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of erenumab in patients with CM from China and other Asian countries. This post hoc analysis evaluated the rate of reversion from CM to EM in the overall population and in subgroups of patients defined by baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (age, body mass index, gender, prior preventive treatment failure, medication overuse status, and disease duration).\nMETHODS: Reversion from CM to EM was defined as a reduction in headache frequency to < 45 headache days over the 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. In addition, migraine-related disability and disease impact on functional impairment were assessed within each treatment group in reverters and non-reverters using the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID), and modified Migraine Disability Assessment (mMIDAS).\nRESULTS: Overall, 557 patients with CM were randomized to monthly erenumab 70 mg (n = 279) or placebo (n = 278), of whom 52.3% (146 of 279) treated with erenumab reverted from CM to EM compared to 41.0% (114 of 278) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.2; p = 0.007). Treatment with erenumab resulted in a greater mean change (standard error) from baseline in the HIT-6 total score for reverters versus non-reverters compared to placebo (erenumab: -9.5 [0.6] vs. -5.1 [0.5]; placebo: -8.9 [0.7] vs. -4.9 [0.5]).

The aim of the present study was to compare anti-CGRP versus anti-CGRP-R mAbs in patients with high frequency episodic and chronic migraine.\nMETHODS: All patients on monthly treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs with an available 6 months' follow-up at January 2022 were included. Data on efficacy outcome were collected following one (T1), three (T3) and six (T6) months of treatment, and included monthly headache/migraine days, the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT-6) scores, pain intensity, analgesics consumption and response rates (>50% headache days reduction compared to baseline).\nRESULTS: In all, 152 patients were enrolled, of whom 68 were in treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs (49 galcanezumab, 19 fremanezumab) and 84 with the anti-CGRP-R (erenumab).

The aim of the present study was to compare anti-CGRP versus anti-CGRP-R mAbs in patients with high frequency episodic and chronic migraine.\nMETHODS: All patients on monthly treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs with an available 6 months' follow-up at January 2022 were included. Data on efficacy outcome were collected following one (T1), three (T3) and six (T6) months of treatment, and included monthly headache/migraine days, the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT-6) scores, pain intensity, analgesics consumption and response rates (>50% headache days reduction compared to baseline).\nRESULTS: In all, 152 patients were enrolled, of whom 68 were in treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs (49 galcanezumab, 19 fremanezumab) and 84 with the anti-CGRP-R (erenumab). MIDAS scores were significantly lower in the anti-CGRP group at T1 and T3 (respectively p < 0.02 and p < 0.03) as well as the number of mean migraine days at T3 (p < 0.01). At T3 and T6 outcome measures were comparable, although a significantly higher percentage of super-responders was found in the anti-CGRP group (respectively p < 0.04 and p < 0.05), with a similar overall percentage of responders.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study on a real-world sample confirms the beneficial effect of both anti-CGRP and anti-CGRP-R mAbs, with a more favorable outcome for anti-CGRP antibodies.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common and disabling primary headache disorder. Several drugs targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), such as erenumab (an anti-CGRP receptor mAb), have been developed recently. However, the real-world effects of erenumab are not well understood.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of erenumab for reducing migraine intensity and frequency in the real world.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to December 2023. Studies estimating the real-world effect of erenumab on monthly migraine days (MMD), monthly headache days (MHD), headache impact test (HIT-6), number of days in medication (NDM), acute monthly intake (AMI), pain intensity (PI) and safety outcomes were included. Meta-analyses of proportions or mean differences were performed.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three studies were included. At 3-months, the effect was -7.18 days for MMD, -6.89 days for MHD, -6.97 for HIT-6, -6.22 days for NDM, -15.75 for AMI, and -1.71 for PI. Generally, the effect at 6- and 12-months increased slightly and gradually. The MMD/MHD response rates revealed that approximately one-third of patients exhibited a response greater than 30%, while one-sixth demonstrated a response exceeding 50%. Additionally, 3-4% of patients achieved a response rate of 100%.

All patients had failed 11 oral preventive treatments. Most of them suffered from chronic migraine (88.6%) and presented a medication overuse (90.7%) at baseline. Thirty-eight (27.1%) discontinued treatment during the 12-month follow-up, with 22 (15.7%), 11 (7.9%) and 5 (3.6%) patients before 3, 6 or 9 months of treatment.

Fifty-three (37.9%) patients reported at least one of the following adverse events: cutaneous erythema and/or pain at the injection site for 42 (30%) patients, constipation for 22 (15.7%) patients, muscle spasm for 2 (1.4%) patients, alopecia for one (0.7%) patient and blood pressure increase in one (0.7%) patient. There was no serious adverse event. One female patient became pregnant after 5 months of exposure to erenumab with a safe evolution after treatment discontinuation.\nCONCLUSION: This first French real-world study related to migraine prevention with CGRP-mAbs confirms effectiveness and safety of erenumab in patients with extreme unmet needs.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of erenumab in a real-world setting in French patients with migraine associated with extreme unmet needs.\nMETHODS: This is a one year-prospective real-word study with enrolment of all consecutive adult patients included in the FHU InovPain registry who participated in a compassionate erenumab use program.\nRESULTS: Of 144 patients included, 140 patients (82.1% female / mean age of 50.9 ± 11.4) received at least one dose of erenumab and were concerned by effectiveness and safety assessment. All patients had failed 11 oral preventive treatments. Most of them suffered from chronic migraine (88.6%) and presented a medication overuse (90.7%) at baseline. Thirty-eight (27.1%) discontinued treatment during the 12-month follow-up, with 22 (15.7%), 11 (7.9%) and 5 (3.6%) patients before 3, 6 or 9 months of treatment. The proportion of ≥ 50% responders at M3, M6, M9 and M12 was 74/140 (52.9%), 69/118 (58.5%), 61/107 (57.0%) and 60/102 (58.8%) respectively. At M3, the rate of reversion from chronic migraine to episodic migraine was 57.3% and the rate of transition from medication overuse to non-overuse was 46.5%. For monthly migraine days, the median (IQR) was 18.0 (13.0-26.0), 9.0 (5.0-17.0), 7.5 (5.0-14.0), 8.0 (5.0-12.5) and 8.0 (5.0-12.0) at M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12 respectively. For HIT-6 score, the median (IQR) was 68.0 (63.8-73.3), 60.0 (54.0-65.0), 60.0 (50.3-53.0), 59.0 (50.0-63.0) and 58.0 (50.0-62.9) at M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12 respectively.
